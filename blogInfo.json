            "<h1>Why is Tax Preparation Business High-Risk?</h1>",
            "<p>Why is Tax Preparation Business considered<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-businesses-and-payment-gateways/\">High-Risk</a>? Each year, millions of American businesses and individuals face the daunting tax of untangling state and federal tax codes. The pressure mounts as April 15th approaches. Even the most straightforward and simple cases can become a formidable challenge if just a single new factor is added.</p>",
            "<p>The total combined amount of money appropriated by the U.S. government from individuals and businesses in some form of tax has ballooned to nearly $3.5 trillion<a href=\"https://datalab.usaspending.gov/americas-finance-guide/revenue/\">per year</a>. That would put the federal government at 8th place on the list of the world\u2019s largest industries by revenue, one rank higher than the automotive industry and one rank below the global oil and gas exploration and production industry. An enormous amount of money is transferred from millions of individuals and businesses to a single recipient each year.</p>",
            "<p>There are many political, economic, and societal implications of this, of course, but one of the most basic is that a whole bunch of people need a whole bunch of help with a whole bunch of issues related to taxes each year, so it is unlikely that we will see much of a decline in the demand for tax preparation services any time soon.</p>",
            "<h2>Label Shock</h2>",
            "<p>That may be why you decided to start your own tax preparation business. One thing you need is a way for clients to pay you. That usually involves a merchant account with a bank or other payment processor. You visit your local bank to make arrangements, and the customer service representative informs you that they don\u2019t accept clients in high-risk industries, one of which is tax preparation.</p>",
            "<p>You may be surprised by that, especially if none of your clients are high-risk businesses. But, the answer is the same at every other bank you try. Some are willing to consider you, but the application process will be long and complex and have stringent requirements for approval.</p>",
            "<h2>High-Risk Merchant Accounts</h2>",
            "<p>This, of course, means that you need a high-risk merchant account. You will need to find a payment processor that is willing to take on clients that are high-risk businesses and that has knowledge and experience in high-risk payment processing, the infrastructure for underwriting high-risk clients, and the technological tools needed to provide timely and reliable payment processing services.</p>",
            "<p>First, however, let\u2019s make sure that we understand what it is about tax preparation businesses that causes banks and payment processors to view them as high risk. Generally speaking, there are three main factors that make tax preparers high risk: unreasonable customer expectations, high chargeback rates, and fraud.</p>",
            "<h2>Risk No. 1: Unreasonable Customer Expectations</h2>",
            "<p>In a way, tax preparers satisfy customers by minimizing their disappointment. That\u2019s not too difficult when you\u2019re able to get your client a hefty refund. However, ultimately, people go to tax preparers not because they want to, but because they need to. They\u2019re not coming to you excited to add something nice to their lives. In general, they\u2019re coming to you expecting help to minimize the amount of \u201csomething nice\u201d that will be lost from their lives.</p>",
            "<p>Businesses and individuals that have been filing taxes for years will likely know what expectations are reasonable and what expectations are destined for betrayal. Many, however, want their returns to be accurate, but accurate in their favor. The smallest change either in the client\u2019s circumstances or the voluminous tax code could end up making the refund much lower than expected, or eliminate it altogether, so this year\u2019s tax bill could be higher than last year\u2019s, even if your business didn\u2019t perform better.</p>",
            "<p>That can make the client feel like you didn\u2019t do a good job or that you cheated him. In many cases, the issue can be resolved quickly by walking the client through the basic steps and calculations of preparing his return. In some cases, though, the client will pay you for your services but will continue stewing about it for a few days, eventually deciding that he wants a refund from<i>you</i>, rather than just from the federal government.</p>",
            "<h3>Picking Your Battles; Cutting Your Losses</h3>",
            "<p>If he contacts you about it, you may be able to talk through it or provide a full or partial refund. However, there is a significant possibility that he will instead contact the credit card company and demand a chargeback. A high frequency of chargebacks is one of the main factors that earn businesses the label \u201cHigh Risk.\u201d It is also a common factor in banks suddenly deciding to cancel your merchant account if you were able to open one. Either way, it will cost you a lot of money if not controlled.</p>",
            "<p>The best way to prevent this is to make sure early in the process that the client knows what can realistically be expected. If you discover something that will make a significant change in the results, let your client know about it as soon as possible, especially if it\u2019s bad news. If you don\u2019t think you can meet your client\u2019s expectations, tell him so. It might lose you a customer, but your straightforward honesty may be what brings him back to you with more reasonable expectations after he finds out that no other tax preparer can meet his original expectations either.</p>",
            "<h2>Risk No. 2: Chargeback Rates</h2>",
            "<p>As mentioned, this risk is often the result of a customer\u2019s unreasonable expectations. Every business can expect to deal with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">chargebacks</a>to some degree, but tax preparation\u2019s higher probability of customer dissatisfaction regardless of how well you do your job increases the risk, and in this case, gives banks a reason to put you in the high-risk business category.</p>",
            "<p>Chargebacks are a drain on time and money for your business and the bank. The bank provides the refund to the customer and then penalizes your account. Providing a refund directly to the customer and preventing a chargeback and the extra cost may be the best way to minimize your loss. Having a clear and reasonable refund policy and maintaining an appropriate level of communication with your clients can make them more likely to contact you first, instead of the bank.</p>",
            "<h3>Chargebacks Have Power in Numbers</h3>",
            "<p>Each month, the bank or payment processor adds up all the chargebacks initiated that month and divides it by the total of all transactions. The resulting percentage is called the \u201cchargeback rate.\u201d Banks set a certain percentage as the maximum acceptable level. The level is not high, and is typically about 3% or less. Exceeding that amount will result in your merchant account being suspended temporarily or canceled outright. If that happens, the loss incurred from the chargeback directly is joined by the loss you will incur from not having a way for your clients to pay you.</p>",
            "<p>Realistically speaking, it\u2019s unlikely that you will be able to eliminate chargebacks completely, but there are various chargeback prevention and management tools available, and a high-risk payment processor will be able to help you keep chargebacks to a minimum, in both quantity and cost.</p>",
            "<h2>Risk Number 3: Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Any situation that involves the recording, calculation, and management of money is a potential target of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-2/\">fraud</a>. Fraudulent chargebacks are one of the most common methods used, and the higher susceptibility of tax preparation businesses to chargebacks means that there is an increased risk of fraud. The fraudster often waits until near the end of the six-month period in which she can initiate a chargeback. This makes it harder to notice since each day creates more separation from when the services were provided and the original payment was made.</p>",
            "<p>As is the case with chargebacks, it\u2019s not realistic to think that all fraud can be eliminated, but managing your business well, thoroughly ensuring compliance with best practices and industry rules and regulations, and paying careful attention to what\u2019s happening in your account can significantly mitigate the risk and minimize the loss incurred if fraud does happen.</p>",
            "<h3>Mitigating Risk in Your Tax Preparation Business</h3>",
            "<p>Knowing the risk factors that have earned your company the label \u201chigh-risk business\u201d is the necessary first step in mitigating those risks. It can also help you answer the question of, \u201cWhy is Tax Preparation Business High-Risk?\u201d If you are just now setting up your business, keep those risk factors in mind as you put everything together. That can reduce the risks from the start. If you have already been in operation for a while, it might be best to start the changes by addressing the risk that is the easiest and quickest to handle.</p>",
            "<p>And, of course, a high-risk payment processor can be a highly effective resource in getting your business off on the right foot as well as in strengthening your protection against risks that could do serious damage. If possible, find a high-risk payment processor that has a good level of experience in the tax preparation industry. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions or to go to a different processor. Your business and the payment processor will both benefit from ensuring that your needs and the processor\u2019s abilities are a good match.</p>"

            "<h1>\u201cFriendly\u201d Fraud</h1>",
            "<p>Just as there are various types of fraud, there are various subtypes of fraud, each with its own set of characteristics that often require countermeasures specific to that subtype. This applies to credit card fraud and its subtypes as well.</p>",
            "<p>Generally, there are three main<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">types of credit card fraud</a>: friendly fraud, chargeback fraud, and true fraud. There is some overlap between the three, of course. For example, in some cases, chargeback fraud can be considered to be a type of friendly fraud, and in other cases, it can be considered to be a type of true fraud.</p>",
            "<h2>Friendly Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>The first type of credit card fraud is commonly referred to as \u201cfriendly fraud.\u201d Generally speaking, friendly fraud is a situation in which a cardholder unintentionally commits fraud by disputing a purchase despite having actually authorized the purchase.</p>",
            "<p>Common causes of this are that the cardholder has forgotten that he made the purchase or does not recognize it on the statement, the cardholder has forgotten about a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-subscription-continuity/\" target=\"_blank\">recurring automatic payment</a>that has a long cycle (e.g., annual memberships), or a member of the cardholder\u2019s family made the purchase without the cardholder\u2019s knowledge.</p>",
            "<p>The cardholder mistakenly believes that he has been charged for a purchase he did not approve. The fact that this was done unintentionally, without malicious intent, is behind the designation of this type of fraud as \u201cfriendly\u201d fraud.</p>",
            "<h2>Preventing Friendly Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Although friendly fraud is typically the result of an honest mistake, you still need to protect your business from the costs and other problems it can create. The following measures are a good place to begin.</p>",
            "<h3>Clear identification of the merchant on the credit card statement</h3>",
            "<p>In most cases, not recognizing a purchase listed on the billing statement is more likely to be due to an unclear description or identification of the merchant than to forgetting the purchase altogether. The merchant or credit card company may understand the jumble of letters and numbers, but it\u2019s of no real help to most cardholders. Be sure that the descriptor used on statements is easy to interpret.</p>",
            "<h3>Prompt resolution of questions and disputes</h3>",
            "<p>Prompt and professional customer service can go a long way toward resolving issues that could otherwise turn into friendly fraud. If the customer feels good about the interaction with customer service, he or she will be more likely to accept the possibility that he or she has made a mistake. That usually means that the customer will be more cooperative in the investigation of the matter, allowing you to resolve it more quickly and to leave the customer with a positive impression.</p>",
            "<h3>Frequent\u2014but not too frequent\u2014contact</h3>",
            "<p>Establishing thorough records of transactions is extremely important for your internal operation, but creating a good paper trail can also help customers remember their purchases.</p>",
            "<p>This can be as simple as e-mailing an order confirmation, a shipping notification, and a follow-up message after the customer has received the items. In the case of recurring bills, a regular reminder can be sent. It may also be appropriate to send other information at times.</p>",
            "<p>Use caution and restraint when doing so. Many businesses tend to let their enthusiasm (or inaccurate understanding of good marketing) drive them to send far too many e-mails to customers and potential customers. Spamming your customers is simply a good way to lose those customers.</p>",
            "<p>The balance can be difficult to achieve, but it is important. Ask your customers for feedback and make sure that they have easy, hassle-free control over the amount of e-mail you send them.</p>",
            "<h2>\"Friendly\" Chargeback Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Chargeback fraud is kind of like a less friendly version of friendly fraud. While the \u201cfraud\u201d in friendly fraud is unintentional, chargeback fraud involves a cardholder knowingly and deliberately disputing a charge and demanding a refund despite knowing that he or she did in fact approve the purchase and actually received the relevant goods and/or services.</p>",
            "<p>There are a variety of reasons that people commit chargeback fraud, the most common of which are \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d missing the deadline for returns, and simply wanting to avoid paying the bill. What began as an innocent mistake becomes an outright crime from the point at which a cardholder realizes his mistake but continues demanding a refund.</p>",
            "<h2>Preventing Friendly Chargeback Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Because chargeback fraud and friendly fraud have a similar pattern, with the former being intentional while the latter is generally unintentional, the things that you can do to prevent them are also the same in many ways. The intentional nature of chargeback fraud does, however, mean that particular attention should be given to certain things. In addition to the measures indicated above for friendly fraud, you should consider implementing the following.</p>",
            "<h3>Skilled and reliable customer service</h3>",
            "<p>If your<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\" target=\"_blank\">customer service</a>staff is skilled and experienced, they will more often than not be able to tell when something isn\u2019t quite right with a dispute. Politely and professionally questioning the customer about the problematic details alone could discourage the person from continuing with the scam.</p>",
            "<p>At the very least, a customer service team that can be politely skeptical when necessary could give you the ability to start investigating as early as possible. The time and effort spent training the team well are likely to provide a variety of benefits, including saving you money and preventing bothersome legal action.</p>",
            "<h3>Effective and reasonable return policy</h3>",
            "<p>Sometimes cardholders don\u2019t understand the deadline for returns or simply forget about it, but still attempt to get a refund by initiating a chargeback. This differs from asking for an exception to be made.<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">Chargeback fraud</a>involves a deliberate attempt to deceive the merchant, etc., while asking for an exception is typically an honest attempt to receive leniency.</p>",
            "<p>Having a clear, easy-to-understand return/refund policy will help you in two ways. First, honest customers will be less likely to forget about a return deadline. Second, it makes it harder for dishonest customers to get around the policy.</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to include enough flexibility that legitimate extenuating circumstances can be taken into consideration. That willingness to listen to the customer and go a little above and beyond to help her often results in a higher degree of customer loyalty and more word-of-mouth advertising for your business.</p>",
            "<h3>Clear and attentive communication</h3>",
            "<p>Consistent and clear communication that isn\u2019t so frequent that it becomes annoying will do much to deter chargeback fraud, friendly or otherwise. The frequent contact itself often discourages scammers from continuing their attempts, but it also gives you more leverage against specious disputes.</p>",
            "<p>This contact can be as simple as sending an order confirmation, a shipping notification, and a follow-up message after the customer has received the items. E-mail communication can include easily seen links to your return/refund policy. Regular reminders for recurring payments and reasonably hassle-free ways to cancel orders can also be helpful.</p>",
            "<h3>Delivery and tracking confirmation</h3>",
            "<p>One of the most common approaches taken by scammers attempting to defraud a merchant is simply to claim that the product was never received. This is where delivery tracking and confirmation can make a huge difference. The technology for tracking and confirmation continues to evolve, and its accuracy is improving.</p>",
            "<p>It may not be possible to get a signature in every case, but many delivery companies now photograph the package at the delivery point, often using an angle from which the location can be identified (e.g., showing the front door of the house). If you have solid evidence that the product was delivered correctly, chances are that the fraudster will back off.</p>",
            "<h2>In Closing</h2>",
            "<p>Although it may be \u201cfriendly\u201d in the sense of being unintentional in many cases, all types of credit card fraud cause businesses and consumers millions of dollars each year. The prevalence of such fraud in some industries can even earn your business the label \u201chigh-risk business\u201d before you even make your first sale.</p>",

            "<p>Regardless of the industry, if you don\u2019t understand the nature and characteristics of your business, it will be impossible to make appropriate decisions in a timely manner. Part of understanding your business is getting a solid grasp on both the actual risks involved in its operation and the degree of risk it is perceived as having, particularly by financial institutions.</p>",
            "<p>We frequently hear the expression \u201chigh-risk business,\u201d but what does it really mean? What, specifically, makes a business \u201chigh-risk\u201d? We may understand intuitively to a certain degree, and might even implement measures to prevent or mitigate incidents that often endanger the financial health and survival of the type of business we operate. However, having your business viewed as \u201chigh-risk\u201d also affects the relationship between the business and financial institutions, and creates certain unique challenges, requirements, and expenses, even if the company has never had any actual incidents of risk becoming reality. Because of this, it may be good to review periodically what the term \u201chigh-risk business\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk merchant</a>\u201d means in that context.</p>",
            "<h2>What Kind of \"High-Risk\" are We Talking About?</h2>",
            "<p>If you were to bring up the topic of \u201chigh-risk businesses\u201d in everyday conversation, most people would probably think of a broad range of types of businesses that have a higher than average rate of failure. The failure may be caused by factors inherent to the type of business, such as the need to anticipate and keep up with changes in technology and consumer preferences, which is very difficult.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, the higher risk could be due to the physical (geographical) location of the business. Location can affect the potential customer base, and it can increase the likelihood of the business suffering theft, violence, or other crime. Some businesses are in niche industries with customer bases that are too small for the number of businesses in the market. There are many reasons that a business venture could be highly risky.</p>",
            "<h3>High-Risk as it Refers to Banks and Processors</h3>",
            "<p>In the context of dealing with banks and other financial institutions, however, there is a much narrower definition of a \u201chigh-risk business,\u201d with numerical criteria and other ways to measure the level of risk the bank would be subjected to if it worked with the business in question. The standards used by banks to decide whether to open a merchant account or provide other financial services to a business typically have little, if anything, to do with the degree of physical threat, etc., the business faces.</p>",
            "<p>So, then, what are the things that banks and other financial institutions usually look for when reviewing an application for something like a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\" target=\"_blank\">merchant account</a>? What, specifically, makes a business high risk in the eyes of a traditional bank reviewing an application for financial services?</p>",
            "<h2>How are High-Risk Businesses Classified?</h2>",
            "<p>There are two general categories, or classifications, for high-risk businesses, namely \u201cRed Zone\u201d businesses and \u201cGrey Zone\u201d businesses.</p>",
            "<h3>The Red Zone</h3>",
            "<p>The \u201cRed Zone\u201d refers to businesses that are considered risky independently of their business history. Some of the factors that can put a business in the \u201cRed Zone\u201d are being in an industry that has a high risk of chargebacks, deals only with services or intangible products, deals in high-volume sales, fails frequently to comply with safety/security standards and regulations, or operates<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-adult/\">\u201cadult-oriented\u201d services</a>(e.g., pornography, gambling, tobacco, weapons, alcohol).</p>",
            "<p>The specific industries that are in the \u201cRed Zone\u201d are quite diverse, and include such industries as digital download services (intangible goods,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-high-volume/\" target=\"_blank\">high-volume</a>sales),<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-tech-support-merchant-account/\" target=\"_blank\">technical support</a>(services only), accounting and tax preparation (seasonal fluctuation, strict compliance requirements, services only), debt consolidation (services only, its target customers have<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-bad-credit/\" target=\"_blank\">poor credit</a>or are otherwise vulnerable), and consumer electronics (high-volume sales, risk of chargeback).</p>",
            "<h3>The Gray Zone</h3>",
            "<p>The \u201cGrey Zone\u201d refers to businesses that are considered risky because of their actual business history. Factors that can put a business in the \u201cGrey Zone\u201d include having a bad business credit score or none at all, having a high rate of chargebacks, being an international merchant, and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/isa-international-service-assessment-fee/\" target=\"_blank\">accepting/dealing with foreign currency</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Businesses considered to be the highest risks are those that are in both the \u201cRed Zone\u201d and the \u201cGrey Zone.\u201d For example, an online gambling business that has repeatedly defaulted on loans and failed to pay bills on time is likely to trigger a red (and grey) flag in the eyes of banks.</p>",

While those accounts are depository\u2014in short, a place to store your money\u2014a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/resources-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">merchant account</a>is actually a line of credit. Two lines of credit are involved each time a credit card is used to make a payment.</p>",
            "<p>The first is the line of credit provided by the credit card company. The company extends credit by making payments on behalf of the cardholder. The cardholder is then required to repay the credit card company according to the conditions stipulated by the company and accepted by the cardholder at the time the card is issued. That typically means paying at least a set portion of the purchase price as the principal plus a certain percentage as interest, which is billed with a monthly statement. The second line of credit is that provided by the bank to the merchant. The bank extends credit to the merchant by depositing funds into the merchant account before the cardholder has actually made the payment.</p>",
            "<p>As with any line of credit, merchant accounts involve a certain amount of risk. There is a gap between the time when the bank deposits money into the merchant account and the time when the cardholder makes a payment. That gap constitutes<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk</a>space for a variety of situations to develop, such as the merchant going out of business, chargeback costs exceeding the account balance, or the merchant committing fraud against customers or the bank.</p>",
            "<h2>Why Did This Happen?</h2>",
            "<p>So, why did the bank close your merchant account? We first need to keep in mind that banks, like any company or individual, have to protect themselves. That means protecting its assets. This is why traditional banks tend to be reluctant to provide merchant accounts to businesses that are considered to be high risk. It also means that if a bank judges that the risk posed by a certain merchant has exceeded acceptable levels, it is likely that the bank will terminate the processing agreement and close the merchant\u2019s account, often very abruptly and without much advance notification.</p>",
            "<p>Generally speaking, there are three things that are most commonly the reason that a bank closes a merchant account. It should be noted that these are also three of the main things that get a business or industry labeled \u201chigh risk.\u201d The three things are as follows.</p>",
            "<h3>Chargebacks</h3>",
            "<p>Chargebacks differ from normal refunds in that they are essentially forced refunds of credit card payments. Excessive chargebacks are the leading reason that banks close merchant accounts. Banks and credit card companies set thresholds for<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">chargeback</a>ratios, which differ by company, etc., but typically do not exceed 1% or 2%. The threshold for a high-risk business could be even lower, and it is likely that the bank will close your merchant account long before the credit card company\u2019s thresholds have been exceeded.</p>",
            "<h3>Actions by the merchant that violate the terms of the agreement</h3>",
            "<p>This can happen in a variety of ways depending on the specific agreement, but two of the most common are depositing money on behalf of other merchants or having multiple merchant accounts with different banks (which is usually prohibited in the processing agreement).</p>",
            "<h3>Fraud</h3>",
            "<p>The most serious of the three main reasons banks close merchant accounts is<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">fraud</a>. That of course means not only that the business will lose its ability to accept payments, but also that the business owner, etc., could face criminal charges as well. The most common ways in which fraud is committed in this context include misuse of credit card information, conducting fraudulent transactions, failing to deliver the purchased products and services, engaging in misleading or false advertising, and overcharging customers.</p>",
            "<p>Now that we have discussed some of the reasons that banks, etc., cancel processing agreements and terminate merchant accounts, in Part 2, we will look at some signs that your account is in danger of being closed, and what to do in the event that it actually is closed.</p>"

            "<h1>What Is True Fraud</h1>",
            "<p>In general, there are three types of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">credit card fraud</a>: friendly fraud, chargeback fraud, and true fraud. In this article, we take a look at true fraud and what you can do to prevent it,<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/scams-your-small-business-guide-business\">minimize the risk</a>, and mitigate loss.</p>",
            "<h2>An Intentional Attempt to Defraud</h2>",
            "<p>Fraud that is unintentional\u2014often the result of a simple mistake\u2014is called \u201cfriendly\u201d fraud. In addition, chargeback fraud often at least begins without any intent to deceive. The most malicious and ill-intended type of credit card fraud is referred to as \u201ctrue\u201d fraud.</p>",
            "<p>True fraud involves the use of a lost or stolen credit card (or credit card information) to make a purchase that was not authorized by the cardholder. One way this differs from the other types of credit card fraud is that it is usually not the cardholder committing the fraud, but instead a third party. The cardholder files a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\" target=\"_blank\">dispute and initiates a chargeback</a>because he or she did not actually make the purchase or authorize the use of the card.</p>",
            "<p>In addition to lost or stolen cards, the fraudster may use counterfeit cards, often with a duplicated magnetic strip. Using the credit card information (account number, PIN, card verification codes, etc.) without actually having the physical card (a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">card-not-present transaction</a>) also falls under this category in certain aspects.</p>",
            "<p>A fake card is sometimes used. A fake card differs from a counterfeit card in that, while the counterfeit card is created to actually function as a credit card, a fake (or disabled) card can be used to get the merchant to enter the information manually. This may create enough of a delay in the transaction being denied that the fraudster will be gone, merchandise in hand.</p>",
            "<h2>Preventing True Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>The loss and damage from true fraud can be enormous, particularly if it is combined with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">chargeback fraud</a>. In such cases, the merchant loses the price of the merchandise twice\u2014once when the product is fraudulently acquired to begin with, then again when a fraudulent chargeback is initiated. Be sure that you and all of your employees understand the seriousness of the risk and consistently implement measures to combat credit card fraud.</p>",
            "<p>The following are some of the common ways to prevent or discourage true fraud.</p>",
            "<h3>No manual payments</h3>",
            "<p>Some fake or doctored credit cards are very skillfully and accurately created, making it difficult to tell the difference between them and real cards. If you have a basic policy of not entering card information manually, you can eliminate this risk completely. Naturally, you are still able to make exceptions for customers that you know and trust.</p>",
            "<h3>Chip readers</h3>",
            "<p>Using a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-retail/\" target=\"_blank\">chip reader</a>takes away the ability of fraudsters to create counterfeit cards by tampering with the magnetic strip. The security functions of the chips continue to be improved, and their usefulness against fraud is expected to increase.</p>",
            "<h3>Cybersecurity measures</h3>",
            "<p>Another area of technology that continues to advance is technology to enhance the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\" target=\"_blank\">security of online transactions</a>. A payment process that does not require the physical card to be present can be highly vulnerable to various types of fraud and tampering.</p>",
            "<p>Fortunately, technology is now available to do things such as denying fraudulent transactions before they are processed. It is anticipated that this technology will continue to be improved as well.</p>",
            "<h3>Security codes</h3>",
            "<p>One type of cybersecurity measure is the use of security codes for card-not-present transactions, whether online, over the telephone, or on a mobile app. Requiring a security code is one way to confirm that the individual making the purchase is in possession of the card.</p>",
            "<p>There are still ways to get around this, of course, but like the other technological measures against fraud, improvements are expected to continue.</p>",
            "<h2>Paying Attention Is The First Step In Protecting Your Business</h2>",
            "<p>Although there is a growing pool of effective technology that you can (and should) use to protect your business from credit card true fraud, the best way to protect yourself is to pay attention and do your due diligence. Simply knowing how fraud occurs and what signs to look for automatically gives you a much better ability to avoid having your business become a victim.</p>",
            "<p>As has been mentioned, one of the reasons that businesses may be given the label \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/whats-considered-a-high-risk-merchant/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk business</a>\u201d is the higher frequency of fraud in the industry. It can, of course, be a factor in having your request to open a merchant account denied by a bank. A record of being the victim of fraud can also result in the bank terminating your payment processing agreement and canceling your account.</p>",
            "<p>Realistically speaking, it is impossible to eliminate all risks of fraud, friendly or otherwise. However, it<i>is</i>possible to minimize that risk. Using the analogy of a castle under siege, you may not be able to build a truly insurmountable wall around your castle, but if the wall is still very difficult to scale, the enemy hordes are more likely to give up their plan and move on to a less imposing stronghold. (Unless it\u2019s an orc horde. Orcs usually aren\u2019t very smart, and they tend to be on the crazy side\u2014even more so when in large groups\u2014so you never really know what they\u2019re going to do. Consult with a qualified wizard or hobbit for information on what to do in such cases.)</p>",
            "<p>For those and other reasons, operators of high-risk businesses need to give particular care and be diligent in their measures against credit card fraud. If you are using a high-risk payment processor, talk to them about things you can do to prevent fraud, and how their measures and your company\u2019s measures against fraud can be used together to give you the best protection possible.</p>"

This is especially true when the new way to buy things involves new technology, this will also include new types of credit card fraud. If you wanted to buy something throughout history, you took whatever served as currency directly to the seller and exchanged it for whatever you were buying. The seller could see that it was, let\u2019s say, Grunk the Hairless from two caves down that was bringing in a basket of polished mammoth teeth to exchange for one of your well-sharpened sticks, possibly the fancy deluxe version that sported stripes painted in berry juice down the shaft.</p>",
            "<p>Even if you didn\u2019t know who it was, you were physically present to receive the payment. It didn\u2019t really matter if the person lied and claimed to be Grunk the Hairless.

            "<p>Caveman A: Yeah.</p>",
            "<p>Caveman B: Yeah\u2026</p>",
            "<p>While it may not have turned out exactly like that, transactions were direct and immediate, and generally remained that way for thousands of years. However, the use of credit cards, particularly for transactions when the merchant and the customer are not physically in the same place, means that any caveman or cavewoman can claim to be Grunk the Hairless and cheat Blort the Stick Sharpener out of a fancy new pointy-stick. It is important for merchants to be familiar with the types of fraud that are the most likely to occur and to stay informed about related changes and trends. If you are operating a business that is considered to be high risk, you may be in an industry that has a particularly<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">high rate of fraud</a>, to begin with, so the consequences could be even more severe.</p>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the three general categories of credit card fraud that are currently most prevalent.</p>",
            "<h2>A Different Type of Credit Card Fraud: Friendly Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>The first type of credit card fraud is commonly referred to as \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/friendly-fraud/\">friendly fraud</a>.\u201d Generally speaking, friendly fraud is a situation in which a cardholder unintentionally commits fraud by disputing a purchase despite having actually authorized the purchase. Common causes of this are that the cardholder has forgotten that he made purchase or does not recognize it on the statement, the cardholder has forgotten about an automatic recurring payment that has a lengthy cycle, or a member of the cardholder\u2019s family made the purchase without the cardholder\u2019s knowledge.</p>",
            "<p>The cardholder mistakenly believes that he has been charged for a purchase he did not approve. The fact that this was done unintentionally, without malicious intent, is behind the designation of this type of fraud as \u201cfriendly\u201d fraud.</p>",
            "<h2>Preventing Friendly Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Although friendly fraud is typically the result of an honest mistake, you still need to protect your business from the costs and other problems it can create. The following measures are a good place to begin.</p>",
            "<h3>Clear identification of the merchant on the credit card statement</h3>",
            "<p>In most cases, not recognizing a purchase listed on the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\" target=\"_blank\">billing statement</a>is more likely to be due to an unclear description or identification of the merchant than to forgetting the purchase altogether. The merchant or credit card company may understand the jumble of letters and numbers, but it\u2019s of no real help to most cardholders. Be sure that the descriptor used on statements is easy to interpret.</p>",
            "<h3>Prompt resolution of questions and disputes</h3>",
            "<p>Prompt and professional customer service can go a long way toward resolving issues that could otherwise turn into friendly fraud. If the customer feels good about the interaction with customer service, he or she will be more likely to accept the possibility that he or she has made a mistake. That usually means that the customer will be more cooperative in the investigation of the matter, allowing you to resolve it more quickly and to leave the customer with a positive impression.</p>",
            "<h3>Frequent\u2014but not too frequent\u2014contact</h3>",
            "<p>Establishing thorough records of transactions is extremely important for your internal operation, but creating a good paper trail can also help customers remember their purchases. This can be as simple as e-mailing an order confirmation, a shipping notification, and a follow-up message after the customer has received the items. In the case of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-subscription-continuity/\" target=\"_blank\">recurring bills</a>, a regular reminder can be sent. It may also be appropriate to send other information at times.</p>",
            "<p>Use caution and restraint when doing so. Many businesses tend to let their enthusiasm (or inaccurate understanding of good marketing) drive them to send far too many e-mails to customers and potential customers. Spamming your customers is simply a good way to lose those customers. The balance can be difficult to achieve, but it is important. Ask your customers for feedback and make sure that they have easy, hassle-free control over the amount of e-mail you send them.</p>",
            "<p>In Part 1, we have looked at some of the issues related to credit card fraud, as well as \u201cfriendly fraud.\u201d In Part 2, we will examine the two other main types of credit card fraud: chargeback fraud and true fraud.</p>"

            "<h1>What To Do If Your Merchant Account Is Closed (Part 2)</h1>",
            "<p>In Part 1, we discussed some of the reasons that banks, etc., cancel processing agreements and terminate merchant accounts. In What To Do If Your Merchant Account Is Closed (Part 2), we will look at some signs that your account is in danger of being closed, and what to do in the event that it actually is closed.</p>",
            "<h2>Trouble on the Horizon</h2>",
            "<p>As mentioned, merchant accounts are often closed suddenly, without notification in advance to any meaningful degree. In a sense, the perception that the termination of the processing agreement occurs suddenly is misleading. Banks have their own process for making the decision, and there are steps taken before the death blow.</p>",
            "<p>The first sign of trouble on the horizon is usually revenue holds. In the case of high-risk businesses, banks usually withhold part of the merchant\u2019s revenue as a reserve to cover losses that may occur, such as insufficient funds in the operating account. The withholding amount is specified in the processing agreement. Often, the merchant is required to provide a reserve at the time the account is opened. It is not rare for the amount to be equivalent to one or two months\u2019 anticipated sales. Rolling reserves are sometimes used to hold back a percentage of sales each month.</p>",
            "<p>If the business already has a merchant account, a reserve could be required (or the amount of the required reserve could be increased) due to the perception that risks have increased. This usually means the factors that make a business high risk in the first place have become more severe, such as a sudden increase in<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">chargebacks</a>or claims of unauthorized transactions. Any time a hold is newly placed on a merchant account, you need to view it and deal with it as a warning sign that the merchant account will probably be closed before the end of the month.</p>",
            "<p>Along with the other problems that will be caused, the bank will probably freeze your funds for a number of months, so it is worth some extra effort and expense to prevent this from happening.</p>",
            "<h2>What Do I Do Now That My Merchant Account Was Closed?</h2>",
            "<p>So, what do you do now? How do you prevent the closing of your merchant account from doing long-term damage to your business?</p>",
            "<p>Each situation will differ to some degree, but generally speaking, you will need to do the following.</p>",
            "<h3>Ask the bank, etc., why your merchant account was closed</h3>",
            "<p>The reason might not be what you assume that it is, and it\u2019s important to know exactly what happened so that you can make any necessary changes.</p>",
            "<h3>Check the Member Alert to Control High-Risk Merchants (MATCH) List</h3>",
            "<p>The MATCH List is a database that provides information about businesses and owners whose merchant accounts have been canceled. Credit card networks require banks to register all terminated merchant accounts on the MATCH List. The process of applying for a new merchant account will be different if your business has been placed on the MATCH List, so it is important to confirm whether it has nor not.</p>",
            "<h3>Be sure to save at least six months\u2019 worth of processing statements</h3>",
            "<p>Confirm that you have all necessary documents before you lose access to the bank\u2019s online reporting system.</p>",
            "<h3>Find a new payment processor</h3>",
            "<p>Having your merchant account closed by the bank, or not being able to open an account in the first place, is certainly bothersome, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re out of options. Don\u2019t waste your time and energy going to a traditional bank or some of the popular payment processors such as<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/\">PayPal</a>. Your business was considered by banks to be high risk to begin with, and actually having a canceled merchant account on your record won\u2019t make them less reluctant to provide a new account. Many banks even have a policy of not providing accounts to businesses that have had a merchant account canceled.</p>",
            "<p>Fortunately, there are payment processors that are willing to work with high-risk businesses, and some of them even specialize in providing services to such businesses. Their experience and expertise can be an enormous resource as you work to get your operation back on track.</p>",
            "<h3>Don\u2019t sugarcoat anything</h3>",
            "<p>Playing down your situation in the hope of making your business more attractive to a new payment processor is not only dishonest, it is also highly unlikely to work out well for you. The new account provider will get the details anyway, and all that you would be doing is providing documented evidence of your untrustworthiness. A high-risk payment processor can be a great benefit to your business, and not being open and honest with them will only make it harder to get your business on track.</p>",
            "<h3>Be patient</h3>",
            "<p>Understandably, the process for taking on a high-risk business as a client is longer than for other businesses opening accounts at traditional banks. The payment processor also wants to finish it as soon as possible, but it\u2019s vital that everything is taken care of properly. Getting upset and abandoning professionalism and basic manners because you mistakenly think that being overbearing is the best way (or even an acceptable way) of getting things done will come back to haunt you eventually, and more often than not, immediately.</p>",
            "<h3>Be complient</h3>",
            "<p>The new payment processor will of course screen you and your business carefully, and will of course be more careful with businesses that have had a merchant account terminated in the past. Make sure that you, your employees, and your business are fully compliant with any existing agreements as well as the relevant laws and regulations. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that everything is fine as long as your company doesn\u2019t cause any major accidents or have any significant problems with product quality, or that financial institutions will be fine with lazy accounting or other lackadaisical management.</p>",

            "<p>Regardless of which industry you are in, your business needs to have a way for customers to pay for goods and services, and for you to receive the payment safely, securely, and in a timely manner. At one time, paying for goods or services consisted of a customer handing a business proprietor a stipulated amount of cash, which would be placed in the drawer of a cash register, in a safe, or possibly in an old, empty cigar box if you were a nine-year-old kid selling paper cups of lemonade on the sidewalk in front of your house. Later, you might have physically carried the cash to your bank and deposited it in your account. It was a simple, straightforward, and inexpensive system that had very few things that could go wrong, which is why it is important to understand the role of high risk payment gateways.</p>",
            "<p>Times change, however, and payments today tend to consist of electrons zipping along wires more than a few coins placed in a cigar box.<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/ultimate-guide-to-credit-card-processing/\" target=\"_blank\">Payment processing</a>involves credit cards/debit cards and other means of payment in which there is no physical transfer of money from the customer to the merchant. Customers may not even have to take their credit cards out of their wallets. The system certainly has benefits, including convenience and the ability to make payments remotely, but it also adds more steps to the process, and more steps means a greater likelihood of something going wrong.</p>",
            "<h2>First, Select a High-risk Processor</h2>",
            "<p>High-risk businesses face some additional challenges related to providing a way for customers to make payments. The most significant of these is the difficulty of obtaining a merchant account either at a traditional bank/financial institution or a payment processing company. If your business is considered by a<a href=\"https://corepay.net/articles/visa-expanding-categories-of-high-brand-risk-merchants-in-october/\">bank</a>to be high risk, you will at the very least have to undergo a lengthy application process that will likely have requirements that are more stringent than those used for applicants that are not high-risk businesses. Traditional banks are very reluctant to take high-risk merchants as clients, so chances are good that your application will be rejected.</p>",
            "<p>As we have discussed in other articles, this obstacle can be overcome by finding a payment processor that works with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk businesses</a>. Such businesses are common enough now that it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find one. However, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t just select one at random. Be sure to find a payment processor that has the software, equipment, experience, and expertise needed to provide consistently trouble-free and reliable payment processing, as well as a solid track record of security.</p>",
            "<p>(<i>Matters related to the selection of high-risk payment processors are addressed in more detail in other articles, both in general and in the context of specific industries. See, for example,</i>[URL]<i>and</i>[URL].)</p>",
            "<p>Even if you have found a good high-risk payment processor, you still need a way to get the payment from your checkout to the payment processor\u2019s system. That way is a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/wordpress-payment-gateway/\" target=\"_blank\">payment gateway</a>.</p>",
            "<h2>What is a High-risk Payment Gateway?</h2>",
            "<p>A payment gateway is a technological middleman between your business and your payment processor. It\u2019s a program that encrypts and transmits credit card data and other transaction information from a business\u2019 checkout to the payment processor. It is a critical component in ensuring secure and reliable online payment acceptance and transaction processing. A high-risk payment gateway is simply a payment gateway provided by a company that works with merchants who are considered to be high risk. As with high-risk payment processors, there are even payment gateway providers that specialize in high-risk businesses.</p>",
            "<p>Fortunately, finding a payment gateway is relatively easy once you have opened an account with a high-risk payment processor. Because payment gateways only encrypt and transfer transaction data to the payment processor, they are subject to less risk than payment processors. There is still some risk involved, however, and not every gateway provider is willing to work with high-risk businesses. The good news is that, just as with payment processors, there are payment gateway providers that are set up to work with and handle the needs of high-risk merchants, sometimes as their specialty.</p>",
            "<h2>What to Look for in a Payment Gateway</h2>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blog-8-2@3x-1024x411.png\"/>",
            "<p>High-risk businesses need payment gateways that can protect them from<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">fraud, chargebacks, and other threats</a>. A high-risk gateway should include controls and screening functions that identify possible risks to your business. Its platform should have filters that block transactions based on specific parameters, such as IP addresses and suspicion of scammers. Its system should be able to verify data and authenticate the identities of people attempting to use a credit card, etc.</p>",
            "<p>Other things to look for are<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/resources-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">PCI compliance</a>, the ability for you to collect your funds without undue delay, and support for diverse means of payment, such as mobile wallets, electronic checks, ACH transfers, major mobile payment solutions, or other payment options you want to use. Some payment gateways even support payments made with cryptocurrency. If you do business internationally, it may be a good idea to ask about support for any relevant foreign currency.</p>",
            "<p>In addition, look at the customer support system. Problems can occur at any time\u2014day, night, or holidays\u2014and some problems can immediately drag your revenue flow to a dead stop, so, ideally, customer service will be available 24 hours a day. At the very least, you should be able to get help during your business hours, or in other words, during any time in which there is a possibility that a payment could be incoming.</p>",
            "<p>Finally, the payment gateway has to integrate well with your business, both from the perspective of the specific type of business and the systems and software you use.</p>",
            "<p>The easiest\u2014and usually the most effective\u2014approach is to utilize a high-risk payment processor that provides its own high-risk payment gateway. Doing so reduces the chance of incompatibility between systems. For example, if the payment processing and payment gateway are provided by two different companies, an update or upgrade of one could negatively affect compatibility. If they are both provided by the same company, any maintenance required for either is likely to take the other into consideration. In addition, it streamlines and centralizes payment system administration, which means you will have more time to grow your business.</p>",
            "<p>Be sure that your high-risk payment gateway fits your business needs. It should keep the amount of administrative work that you have to carry to a minimum, and should protect your business when accepting payments. It should take the worry out of collecting funds, and provide a level of customer service that promptly and appropriately addresses questions and concerns whenever you have them. The important thing is to make sure that the payment gateway is able to meet the needs of<i>your</i>business so that you are better able to meet the needs of<i>your</i>customers.</p>"

            "<h1>Mitigating Inevitable Chargebacks at the Gate</h1>",
            "<p>Every business that accepts payment by credit card knows the expense in both time and money that<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">chargebacks</a>can cause. Chargebacks can be initiated for a variety of reasons, of course. Some are questionable, or even fraudulent. On the other hand, many are legitimate, or at least understandable. Typically, the cause is some type of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer regarding the product, the services, or the transaction itself. Here are a few tips to start mitigating inevitable chargebacks at the gate.</p>",
            "<p>Naturally, even legitimate<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-strict-refund-policies-can-hurt-you/\" target=\"_blank\">chargebacks are preventable</a>. Customers don\u2019t<i>have</i>to be dissatisfied, and they don\u2019t<i>have</i>to demand a refund when everything isn\u2019t perfect. The reality, though, is that customers<i>will</i>be dissatisfied at times, and<i>will</i>demand a refund on many of those occasions.<a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/cas/chargback_guide.pdf\">Chargebacks</a>are, strictly speaking, preventable, but they are, realistically speaking, inevitable.</p>",
            "<h2>Mitigate the Inevitable chargebacks at the gate</h2>",
            "<p>What is inevitable, however, is the<i>occurrence</i>of chargebacks, not the number, frequency, or scale. Those aspects of the inevitable can be mitigated to one degree or another. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that, just as chargebacks themselves can be expensive for your business, mitigation measures can be a drain on resources as well if they are not managed wisely.</p>",
            "<p>So, what will<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/resources-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">mitigate the damage of chargebacks</a>while at the same time mitigating the damage of chargebacks? Since a leading cause of chargebacks is customer dissatisfaction, reducing that dissatisfaction can be expected to reduce the risk of chargebacks. The simplest and most cost-effective approach is to start with the transaction itself.</p>",
            "<p>Why the transaction and not the products and services? One reason is that you\u2019re probably already working on those elements of your business and are already investing enough time and money that it may not be practical to invest more. Most business owners are keenly aware that they won\u2019t be in business long if their products and services fail to satisfy customers.</p>",
            "<p>Another reason is that improving and developing products and services is a lengthy process. What we want to do is to achieve the most positive impact in the most efficient way possible. Chargebacks are costing you money, so reducing them this week is preferable to reducing them next week.</p>",
            "<h2>Start With Checkout</h2>",
            "<p>Many online shoppers put items in their shopping cart only to abandon the cart without checking out. This phenomenon has been the subject of extensive research that indicates that there are many reasons for it to happen. Often it is as simple as using the shopping cart as a kind of \u201cbookmark\u201d to save the item for further consideration. The shopping cart ends up being the \u201cmaybe cart.\u201d If the shopper finds the product at a better price somewhere else, he or she might not return to the earlier website to empty the cart.</p>",
            "<h2>Shoppers Want an Easy, Straightforward Checkout Process</h2>",
            "<p>In other cases, however, the problem is the checkout process itself. Your customers want to pay for their purchases as quickly and easily as possible. At a physical cash register, the customer hands cash to the cashier or uses a keypad for credit cards and is then immediately able to walk out of the store with the purchased items. When purchasing something online, shoppers want the process to be as close to that simple exchange as possible. They are willing to tolerate a few unavoidable extra steps, such as providing an address for delivery, but anything more is an annoyance.</p>",
            "<p>Even if the customer ends up making the purchase, the quality of the customer\u2019s experience making the payment could be the factor that tips the scales if the customer is considering a chargeback. If the customer is a little dissatisfied with the product or is simply feeling some \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d the memory of a negative experience trying to pay for the product could artificially inflate that product-related dissatisfaction. So, the easier, simpler, and quicker the payment process the better. This will help you start Mitigating Inevitable Chargebacks at the Gate.</p>",
            "<h3>No Surprises! Clarity mitigates chargebacks</h3>",
            "<p>One of the biggest annoyances when trying to make a payment is surprises, with hidden fees and unexpected shipping costs being the main culprits. Such surprises are often the reason that the shopper decides against making the purchase, but also leave the customer with a negative impression even if the purchase is made. This means that, in addition to making the process simple and straightforward, you need to be clear about any additional costs or other requirements for making the purchase from the beginning.</p>",
            "<p>Customers prefer to have no additional fees, of course, but if reducing or eliminating the fees is not possible, being upfront about them from the start can help minimize the negative impact. For example, if possible, display shipping costs, taxes, and fees beforehand instead of waiting until the customer is checking out.</p>",
            "<h2>Avoid Making Customers Do Extra Work</h2>",
            "<p>Another annoyance is being required to create an account on the website. In many cases, the customer will<i>want</i>to create an account. If the customer anticipates making additional purchases from your business in the future, for example, having an account can be very convenient. However, there are times when a shopper simply wants to purchase<i>this</i>product<i>this</i>one time, and doesn\u2019t want to take the time to provide additional personal information, think of a user name, then a different user name because the first one is already taken, decide whether to come up with a new password or use the same one he\u2019s been using since 1997, check e-mail for the confirmation code, then go back to the website to enter the confirmation code, all before making the purchase, which is the<i>only</i>reason the customer is on your website in the first place. This can be avoided by providing the option to check out as a guest.</p>",
            "<h2>Letting Customers \u201cThink About It\u201d</h2>",
            "<p>Although it may seem counterintuitive, making it easier for customers to decide<i>not</i>to make a purchase can often be the best option, especially when mitigating inevitable chargebacks at the gate. Let\u2019s say that a customer considered purchasing a product, but decided against it. In that case, you lose the revenue from the sale, or more accurately, you don\u2019t get the increase that you would have gotten from the sale. No harm, no foul.</p>",
            "<p>Now, let\u2019s say that a customer purchases that product then later<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-fight-large-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">initiates a chargeback</a>. You still lose the revenue from the sale, but you also incur costs related to processing the chargeback and using resources for activities that don\u2019t move your business forward. Your business ends up with less than if the customer had never even considered making the purchase in the first place.</p>",
            "<p>So, particularly in<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/whats-considered-a-high-risk-merchant/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk industries</a>that have a higher rate of chargebacks, it\u2019s important to have a step in which you show the customer the details of the purchase in a clear and easy-to-understand manner and request confirmation. Customers who end up initiating a chargeback due to something other than problems with product quality (e.g., buyer\u2019s remorse) often have some misgivings about the purchase, to begin with. They may get past those misgivings with an impulse buy. However, if they are given one more chance to see the details and reevaluate the purchase, they may decide that they really don\u2019t want the item as much as they thought they did.</p>",
            "<p>Even if the customer decides not to finalize the purchase at that time, you haven\u2019t necessarily lost the sale. The customer may think about it and ultimately decide to buy the item from you, and the determining factor in the decision to buy it from<i>your</i>business may be the clear, upfront, and the pressure-free manner in which you showed the customer exactly what she was getting herself into.</p>",
            "<h2>Work With Your Payment Processor to Mitigate Chargebacks at the gate</h2>",
            "<p>Good<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk payment processors</a>have the knowledge and experience to minimize the impact that chargebacks have on your business. Be sure to ask questions and discuss any concerns, whether you\u2019re looking for a high-risk payment processor or you already have one. While it is true that they specialize in these issues, there are limitations to what they can do, even in the best of circumstances. Measures against chargebacks are most effective when you and your payment processor work as partners. Don\u2019t forget to use that valuable resource.</p>"

            "<p>Over the next two posts, we\u2019re going to take a look at two types of business that may seem to be very different\u2014and they do indeed project contrasting images to the general public\u2014but are both considered to be high-risk businesses. First, we are going to dive into what makes credit repair high-risk. Our hope is that these concrete examples will help you gain a better understanding of the nature and challenges of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\">high-risk businesses</a>. That knowledge will arm you to make better decisions for your business and implement measures that will more effectively take your business in the direction you have chosen.</p>",
            "<p>The first type of business that we will examine is credit repair services. What is \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-credit-repair-merchant-accounts/\">credit repair</a>\u201d anyway? To repair something is to take it from a state of being broken or malfunctioning to a state of being whole or functioning correctly. So, \u201ccredit repair\u201d is the act of making broken credit whole. Or in other words, the act of making bad credit good.</p>",
            "<p><strong>ORIGIN</strong></p>",
            "<p><em>The origins of the English word \u201ccredit\u201d can be traced back to the Latin word credere, which means \u201cto trust, entrust, or believe.\u201d It\u2019s related to the word \u201ccreed,\u201d which refers to a statement or collection of beliefs. So, your \u201ccredit\u201d is really just another way of saying \u201cthe degree to which certain parties trust you to fulfill your obligation to return something that you have borrowed.\u201d (Note that the Latin word creditum refers to something entrusted to a person.) In our current context, then, \u201ccredit\u201d is \u201cthe degree to which banks and other financial institutions trust you to pay back the money you have borrowed, and to pay it back according to the terms you agreed to.</em></p>",
            "<p>Credit repair businesses are, of course, part of the extremely broad financial industry. The services they provide include coaching on general financial matters, as well as more focused guidance on specific financial issues. Two of the most common things that people go to credit repair businesses for are to get help improving their credit scores and to get help with debt consolidation. With unwise and<a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny\">unhealthy levels of debt</a>so prevalent in the United States currently, stretching from single individuals to the federal government, it should be no surprise that credit repair is a growing market.</p>",
            "<h2>Here Is What You Should Consider</h2>",
            "<p>There are a variety of reasons that your credit score changes. One important part of credit repair is to increase the number of factors that will improve your credit score and to decrease the number of factors that lower your score. Some of the things that hurt your credit score can be prevented, and it is often a very simple process. For example, assuming that you have enough income to cover your reasonable needs, you can simply pay your bills on time. You can pay back loans according to the set schedule. You can avoid having (or even applying for) more credit cards or loans that are realistically necessary. Make a budget and follow it.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, much of what we experience in life is unforeseen and unpreventable. Sometimes we have financial struggles despite making wise choices, exercising self-control, and otherwise doing our best. It could be caused by illness, injury, or death. We may lose a job due to a severe economic downturn, or simply because changes in technology or circumstances have changed or even eliminated the market. Maybe we thoughtfully and carefully made an investment in a business venture that was expected to succeed, but factors outside our control prevented it from happening. Maybe we were simply wrong in our assessment of and approach to some financial matter. Maybe we thought that we would be good enough at something to make a living doing it but ended up not being good at it. At all.</p>",
            "<p>All of those things can result in a person finding himself or herself in some degree of financial difficulty. In such cases, we will probably be unable to do all of the things that will improve our credit score and maintain it at a favorable level. More often than not, the inability to do the things that help your credit is identical to doing the things that hurt your credit. For example, paying your bills on time is good for your credit score. If you lose the ability to pay your bills on time, you will miss payments or make them late. Missing payments or making them after the deadline is bad for your credit score. This is part of what makes credit repair high-risk.</p>",
            "<p>When people get deep enough in debt or have their credit score drop far enough, it\u2019s easy to feel like there\u2019s no way out. In such cases, getting help from a credit repair service or a qualified adviser may be the answer. Even if you are not in financial straits, acquiring the tools and knowledge to wisely manage your finances on your own is a very good idea for<i>everyone</i>.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blog-6-2@3x-1024x281.png\"/>",
            "<h2>Risks Inherent to Credit Repair Services</h2>",
            "<p>One reason that a credit repair business might be seen as high-risk is that the business\u2019 customers are all people who are having problems making payments, or who have a history of such problems. That means that your business faces an extra high risk of not getting paid. If your business has insufficient revenue, the bank that processes the payments to your business is at risk of not getting paid.</p>",
            "<p>Another factor that may result in your business being seen as high-risk is the risk of fraud. There are, unfortunately, people and businesses that target people who are desperate or otherwise vulnerable. An advertisement for debt consolidation at an amazing interest rate could actually be a golden ticket to having your identity stolen. The nominal fee that you\u2019re asked to pay for consulting services may end up financing scammers\u2019 purchases of illegally obtained names and phone numbers.</p>",
            "<p>The clients of credit repair companies may even be the ones engaging in<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/true-fraud/\">fraud</a>. Scammers will approach from whatever angle works in a specific situation. If you are careful with your business, aware of the possibility of fraud, etc., and use common sense and basic critical thinking, it should not be difficult to protect your business from fraud. The problem is that many people do not use care, maintain awareness, use common sense, or employ basic critical thinking, and are therefore susceptible to being deceived. Banks and other financial institutions know that, and may automatically assume that your business has a high possibility of being victimized by a scammer.</p>",
            "<p>However, having your business labeled \u201chigh-risk\u201d and being unable to open a business account to have payments processed in a big bank is not a death blow. There are other options available, such as utilizing payment processing services, which have a variety of advantages anyway. There are even payment processors that specialize in providing services to high-risk businesses and industries. They are designed specifically to deal with and overcome the variety of obstacles that are created when a business is slapped with the label \u201cHigh Risk.\u201d</p>"

What does that mean? What are the consequences of being a high-risk business? Many of the difficulties and challenges faced by high-risk businesses are related to e-commerce payment processors and financial institutions. Keep in mind that some payment processors and financial institutions are more resistant than others to dealing with high-risk businesses, while some are less hesitant, and some even<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\" target=\"_blank\">specialize in high-risk industries</a>. Below, we\u2019ll look at some of the common challenges that high-risk businesses face.</p>",
            "<h2>More Strict Application Requirements</h2>",
            "<p>Applying for financing or payment processing may be more difficult for high-risk businesses. Banks and other financial institutions usually prefer to deal with businesses that present the least risk possible. In some cases, the bank will find that a business is high-risk during the application and approval process. For example, when checking the business\u2019 history, the bank may find that the company has a history of missing payments. This would put the business in the \u201cGrey Zone\u201d that we discussed in<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>. The application may be denied at that point, but if the application process is allowed to continue, the bank may apply stricter criteria for approval.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, if the business is in the \u201cRed Zone\u201d or otherwise known to be high-risk regardless of its business record, the stricter criteria for approval may be applied from the start. That means that the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/resources-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">application process</a>could be longer, more complex, and have more and tighter requirements. Those requirements could be submittal of a larger amount of supporting evidence regarding the business\u2019 finances or maintaining a certain minimum reserve in the business\u2019 account. (The latter is often a certain percentage of the business\u2019 sales.)</p>",
            "<h3>Compliance</h3>",
            "<p>Health and safety requirements are sometimes more stringent for high-risk businesses or industries, and the assessment of compliance may be more strict. In some cases, regulating authorities may conduct investigations and inspections more frequently. Business that are particularly susceptible to fraud, such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">e-commerce websites</a>, tend to be the target of such action. Industries that score high on the U.S. Health and Human Services Risk Index are in the same boat. These risks can be mitigated or eliminated, but it requires strict compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard in the case of online businesses.</p>",
            "<h3>Chargebacks</h3>",
            "<p>Businesses that deal with high volumes of online sales and other high-risk businesses are especially susceptible to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-fight-large-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">chargebacks</a>. \u201cChargeback\u201d refers to cases in which a customer disputes a charge made to your business due to things such as attempted fraud using the customer\u2019s account or some failure attributable to the merchant. If a chargeback request results in a refund to the customer, your business will not be compensated for any loss. Not only is the revenue from the sale lost, but the business must spend time and money processing the chargeback and providing a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-strict-refund-policies-can-hurt-you/\" target=\"_blank\">refund</a>, in addition to other clerical and administrative work that is generated by a chargeback. Some high-risk businesses lose thousands of dollars in revenue to chargebacks each year. Because of this, many high-risk businesses invest in chargeback prevention and protection services.</p>",

            "<h2>High-Risk Merchant Accounts for Business</h2>",
            "<p>Many high-risk businesses are unable to accept credit cards and other non-cash payments unless they have a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk merchant account</a>. Your business will process credit card payments through a high-risk merchant account. So, how is this type of account different from a conventional low-risk merchant account? One way is that it is able to accommodate businesses in industries that other financial institutions, etc., are not able to service. That means that you will have a much smaller selection of payment processors. It also means that you will pay higher fees than you would to low-risk payment processors.</p>",
            "<p>These and other factors can make it a challenge to find the right payment processor to partner with, and it may take some time and effort to look into the available processors and merchant accounts. However, businesses in the \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Zone</a>\u201d often need to have a high-risk merchant account, and such accounts and payment processors can be very helpful in mitigating risks and running your business effectively.</p>",
            "<h3>Selecting the Right Payment Processor</h3>",
            "<p>When<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\" target=\"_blank\">selecting potential payment processors</a>, be sure to ask questions and get clarification of anything you don\u2019t understand. It will be a partnership, so pay attention to gaining a mutual understanding of expectations, requirements, and the details of services. The ideal is to find a payment processor that specializes in high-risk businesses, but either way, it\u2019s important to find a payment processor that has a wide range of technological tools, a solid commitment to thorough compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards, and a secure payment system and gateway.</p>",
            "<p>Such a partner can alleviate many of your concerns about security and fraud, and can go far in automating your business, making the payment process itself more efficient and problem-free, and ultimately helping you save money and retain customers.</p>"

            "<h1>What\u2019s Considered a High-Risk Merchant?</h1>",
            "<p>There used to be a time when cash was king for consumers and merchants when transacting business. But things began to change during the 1970s with the explosion of bank and nonbank-issued credit cards. These days,<a href=\"https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2020/The-case-for-contactless-payments---TBD/default.aspx\">approximately 73% of businesses</a>prefer that customers use cards or apps when making purchases \u2014 and most customers prefer to do so anyway, part of the consideration in what\u2019s considered a high-risk merchant.</p>",
            "<p>Consequently, businesses that don\u2019t accept plastic are at a competitive disadvantage and likely to lose substantial sales. This issue can even be more daunting for companies categorized as high-risk entities, as they can face challenges when establishing merchant accounts for processing credit card payments. Continue reading to learn more about what a high-risk merchant account is and how you can find the right payment processor.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"When a financial institution approves a credit card account for a business, it essentially extends a loan to the merchant, expecting that the company will receive the funds from its customers and cover the credit card payments.\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/02-What-does-high-risk-merchant-mean-rev1.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>What Does High-Risk Merchant Mean?</h2>",
            "<p>When a financial institution approves a credit card account for a business, it essentially extends a loan to the merchant, expecting that the company will receive the funds from its customers and cover the credit card payments.</p>",
            "<p>However, in some businesses or industries, there\u2019s a higher likelihood that a merchant won\u2019t be able to process a credit card transaction. When that happens, the bank is on the hook because the buyer\u2019s money for the purchase has already been transferred to the seller\u2019s account and the bank has no way to recover it. Because many financial institutions don\u2019t want to accept the risk, companies often must seek a high-risk merchant account for their payment processing needs.</p>",
            "<p>The following are examples of what\u2019s considered a high-risk merchant :</p>",
            "<p>Alongside being a part of one of the above industries, businesses may be high-risk because of these factors:</p>",
            "<h2>Frequent Legislative Changes</h2>",
            "<p>Some industries, such as those related to alcohol and firearms, are susceptible to frequent changes in laws and regulations that impact their ability to conduct business. This uncertainty creates a red flag for many financial institutions, as it often leads to instability, higher costs and lower profits.</p>",
            "<h2>\"Questionable\" Products or Services</h2>",
            "<p>Part of what\u2019s considered a high-risk merchant has to do with reputation-conscious payment processors refusing to do business with companies because they\u2019re uncomfortable with what they offer. For example, they may refuse to deal with entities that sell adult materials, tobacco, vaping equipment or marijuana paraphernalia.</p>",
            "<h2>Limited Experience</h2>",
            "<p>Often, banks are leery of working with startups or businesses without an extensive track record. These financial institutions may have concerns about the company\u2019s long-term viability, shortage of resources or lack of experience with payment processing.</p>",
            "<h2>Irregular Revenues</h2>",
            "<p>Additionally, banks like to see that a company can generate a consistent revenue stream throughout the year before approving a merchant account. Therefore, industries that operate seasonally, such as landscaping, snow removal, outdoor recreation, tax preparation and swimming pool installation and cleaning, may have difficulty opening a merchant account.</p>",
            "<h2>Heavy Competition</h2>",
            "<p>Many financial institutions view a company attempting to succeed in a saturated market as a high-risk business. These merchants face stiff competition, so the chances of failing are higher. These entities may need to charge lower prices for their products or services to attract customers, which may not generate enough profits to remain viable</p>",
            "<h2>Threat of Obsolescence</h2>",
            "<p>Continuing advances in technology threaten to put some companies \u2014 and even entire industries \u2014 out of business. Some payment processors will shy away from an entity in an industry that faces an uncertain future or could be easily replaced by computers or automated processes.</p>",
            "<h2>High Chargeback Potential</h2>",
            "<p>A chargeback occurs when customers demand that a merchant return their payment for a product or service they\u2019ve purchased by reversing the charge on their credit card. A<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-fight-large-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">significant chargeback rate</a>is a warning sign to financial institutions, potentially indicating higher fraud potential. Therefore, banks are wary of businesses with a notable number of chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>A business that offers<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-subscription-continuity/\" target=\"_blank\">free trials or subscriptions</a>that automatically charge credit cards at the end of a designated time frame is more prone to chargebacks. Many customers forget that they signed up for the service and will demand a refund when they become aware of the charge.</p>",
            "<h2>Selling High-Ticket Items</h2>",
            "<p>Furthermore, companies that offer expensive goods or services for sale may have difficulty obtaining a merchant account. Generally, the more an item costs, the greater the risk of fraud. The buyer\u2019s remorse that may occur when customers realize they paid a lot of money for a product that doesn\u2019t meet their expectations can also contribute to a higher chargeback rate.</p>",
            "<h2>Poor Personal Credit</h2>",
            "<p>As most small businesses are sole proprietorships or partnerships, the owners must often depend on their personal credit to obtain financing or open a merchant account. If their credit score doesn\u2019t meet a certain threshold, banks will likely classify them as high-risk businesses and reject their application making them what\u2019s considered a high-risk merchant.</p>",
            "<h2>Location</h2>",
            "<p>Many businesses \u2014 especially online entities \u2014 that sell their products to U.S. customers have their headquarters in another country. In these cases, banks are often reluctant to set up merchant accounts due to the higher fraud risk. It can also be more challenging to gather reliable information about these organizations during the vetting process.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"About-high-risk-credit-card-processing-pinterest\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/03-About-high-risk-credit-card-processing-pinterest-rev1.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>About High-Risk Credit Card Processing</h2>",
            "<p>While businesses in the industries listed above \u2014 and many others \u2014 may have difficulty opening a merchant account with traditional financial institutions, they do have other options. This gap in the market has paved the way for companies specializing in providing high-risk credit card services across multiple industries.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019ve been unsuccessful in your quest to obtain a \u201ctraditional\u201d merchant account, there are several best practices you can apply to try to improve your situation:</p>",
            "<h3>1. Do Your Due Diligence</h3>",
            "<p>The first step will likely involve conducting research online to find a company that offers payment processing services for businesses like yours. While you\u2019re doing your homework, be aware that there are some companies that don\u2019t deliver on their promises or charge exorbitant fees for their services. Knowing how to avoid them will keep your business protected.</p>",
            "<p>For example, a poorly designed website can be a tipoff that a high-risk merchant account provider will scam you. Aside from examining the website, look at the reviews to see what the company\u2019s customers have to say. If you spot a high ratio of negative-to-positive reviews, you should look elsewhere.</p>",
            "<h3>2. Be Aware of Too-Quick Approvals</h3>",
            "<p>Just as you should do a thorough vetting of high-risk merchant account providers, you can expect they\u2019ll do the same when reviewing your application. If a company promises fast approvals or requests limited information about you and your business, it\u2019s probably a sign that it\u2019s not a legitimate entity or will charge ridiculously high payment processing fees.</p>",
            "<h3>3. Boost Your Credit Score</h3>",
            "<p>While you likely won\u2019t need as high of a credit score when applying for a high-risk credit account as when working with a traditional bank, a more favorable score can often result in lower processing fees. Improve your score \u2014 and your standing with prospective payment processors \u2014 by reducing your debt load, making timely payments to your creditors and avoiding applying for additional credit.</p>",
            "<h3>4. Don't Misrepresent Your Situation</h3>",
            "<p>While your attempts to find a low-risk merchant account provider may have been frustrating, avoid the temptation to provide false or inaccurate information when applying for a high-risk account. The partner you choose will likely discover the truth when you start receiving credit card payments from your customers. As a result, you could end up on the Terminated Merchant File (TMF) list, making it much more challenging to set up a merchant account in the future.</p>",
            "<h3>5. Find a Provider That Works With Multiple Banks</h3>",
            "<p>No two high-risk businesses are alike, and the payment processing challenges can vary significantly between companies and industries. By partnering with a merchant account payment provider with access to an extensive network of banks, you can increase your approval odds and are more likely to find the perfect solution for your business.</p>",
            "<h3>6. Choose a Company With a High Approval Rate</h3>",
            "<p>Although you should be wary of a provider that promises almost immediate approval, you also don\u2019t want to waste time applying with one that turns most businesses down. A<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">reputable high-risk merchant provider</a>that works with multiple banks and has a reasonable minimum credit score standard should be able to work with you. These companies specialize in helping people in your situation and can help you navigate the obstacles on the way to approval.</p>",
            "<h2>Getting Approved as a High-Risk Merchant</h2>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re seeking to work with a high-risk payment processing company for the first time, you should become familiar with the application and approval process. A few examples of what\u2019s considered a high-risk merchant and what you should be ready for :</p>",
            "<h3>Cover Letter</h3>",
            "<p>Increase your odds of approval by preparing and submitting a cover letter to the prospective account provider. This document should highlight the most attractive features of your business. For example, the company may view you more favorably if you have extensive experience in your industry or a successful track record as a small business owner. Include information about steps you\u2019re planning to take to ensure smooth, safe credit card transactions, such as taking a proactive approach to fraud monitoring.</p>",
            "<h3>Additional Information</h3>",
            "<p>Expect any payment processor to order a credit report to verify your credit score and look for red flags regarding your payment history and other areas. Also, you\u2019ll need to provide your tax returns and whatever other financial documentation the provider deems appropriate.</p>",
            "<h3>Contract Duration</h3>",
            "<p>Sometimes, you have to engage in a longer contract when working with a high-risk payment processor than you would with a traditional bank. While doing so can give you a feeling of security, it might not be beneficial in the long run. If your business\u2019s status changes and you move into a low-risk classification, you\u2019ll still be locked into the higher rates for the remainder of the agreement. Keep this point in mind as you negotiate the length of the term with the provider.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"With this more subjective approach, the processor will charge a price based on how qualified it believes your business is \u2014 the higher the perceived risk, the higher the fee, and vice-versa.\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/04-Pricing-structure-rev1.jpg\"/>",
            "<h3>Pricing Structure</h3>",
            "<p>In most cases, providers will offer a tiered pricing program to high-risk businesses. With this more subjective approach, the processor will charge a price based on how qualified it believes your business is \u2014 the higher the perceived risk, the higher the fee, and vice-versa. This pricing structure is typically more expensive.</p>",
            "<p>Although not as common, some processors may implement an interchange-plus pricing arrangement. It\u2019ll charge a small transaction fee, typically a percentage of the item\u2019s purchase price plus an additional amount that goes to the merchant account provider. This method offers more transparency than the tiered pricing model and is usually more favorable to the business.</p>",
            "<h3>Chargeback Fees</h3>",
            "<p>As merchant account providers aren\u2019t fond of chargebacks, expect to pay a fee when they occur. These costs can be much more significant for high-risk businesses. If chargebacks are common in your daily operations, you\u2019ll want to know how much they could impact your company\u2019s bottom line. Consider checking with several processors and compare this contract feature.</p>",
            "<h3>Reserves</h3>",
            "<p>Some high-risk merchant account companies may demand to keep a portion of your business\u2019s credit card sales for protection against excessive chargebacks or fraud. Depending on the agreement, the processor may release the funds back to you if there are no issues. It could also place a specified sum in an escrow account and hold onto the money until it receives an equal amount in processing fees.</p>",
            "<p>In another scenario, the company may charge an additional percentage for each transaction until the reserve fund reaches an amount listed in the contract.</p>",
            "<h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>",
            "<p>Many payment processors will offer a contract that renews automatically at the end of the designated period. Check the terms closely before signing to determine if this clause exists. Depending on your situation, you might want to explore other merchant account options in the future, meaning that an agreement that rolls over might not be in your best interests. Note whether you need to give the processor advanced notice if you don\u2019t want the contract to continue.</p>",
            "<h3>Account Freezing and Termination</h3>",
            "<p>The provider could terminate the agreement before the contract expiration date if your business experiences excessive chargebacks, numerous incidents of fraud or other issues. It may also choose to freeze your account for a time, which will prevent your business from accepting credit card or debit card payments. Read the agreement carefully to determine what could jeopardize your standing with the merchant account company and potentially put you out of business.</p>",

            "<h1>Are Travel-Related Businesses High-Risk?</h1>",
            "<p>Are Travel-Related Businesses High-Risk? When we think about businesses that financial institutions consider to be<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\">\u201chigh risk\u201d</a>in the context of payment processing, we typically think of industries such as alcohol and tobacco,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-firearms/\" target=\"_blank\">firearms</a>,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-credit-repair-merchant-accounts/\" target=\"_blank\">credit repair</a>, and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-adult/\">adult entertainment</a>. One that may not immediately come to mind, however, is the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-travel-merchant-account/\" target=\"_blank\">travel industry</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Even within the travel industry, there is a variety of diverse types of business, which typically includes travel agencies, tour operators, lodging, transportation, timeshare resellers, travel reservation websites, charters, and ticket sales, as well as independent travel agents. Each of these has its own unique challenges and requirements, but the ones mentioned in this article are, as a general rule, applicable in each of them.</p>",
            "<p>We should point out here at the beginning that a business being considered to be \u201chigh risk\u201d has more to do with the industry than a specific company. It is related to the degree of financial risk that is inherent in sales transactions in the particular industry. Many<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201chigh-risk\u201d businesses</a>actually have a long history of honest, sound, successful operation. Being a \u201chigh-risk\u201d business creates certain challenges, but it is by no means a judgment of the societal worth of a business or a prediction of its failure.</p>",
            "<h2>What Makes the Travel-Related Businesses High Risk?</h2>",
            "<p>So, what is it that makes a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-travel-merchant-account/\" target=\"_blank\">travel-related business</a>\u201chigh risk\u201d in the eyes of banks and other payment processors? Are travel-related businesses High-risk? Two of the most common factors that make a business high risk are<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">fraud and chargebacks</a>. Fraud occurs most frequently when higher amounts of money are involved. The possibility of getting a payout of $5.00 isn\u2019t worth the risk of being sent to prison for most criminals. A travel business is more likely to have a transaction involving $1,000 than a transaction of only $10.00. In addition, online transactions create more opportunities for fraud, and travel-related business is increasingly being conducted via the Internet. If parties in multiple countries are involved, the risks increase even more.</p>",
            "<h3>High Ticket Prices, Chargebacks, and Buyer's Remorse</h3>",
            "<p>A chargeback occurs when a customer requests a refund of money spent on a purchase. This happens when a customer disputes a purchase for one reason or another. Sometimes the reason is that a customer asserts that he or she did not make the purchase and that the card or the card number was used illegally by an unauthorized person. In the travel industry,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-fight-large-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">chargebacks</a>are typically due to a customer changing his or her mind, or feeling \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse.\u201d As with fraud, this usually occurs with purchases that have a higher price.</p>",
            "<p>Buyer\u2019s remorse is more likely to occur after buying something for a couple thousand dollars than for a purchase of $5.00. If the customer didn\u2019t spend much money on the purchase, it just might not be worth the bother of trying to get a refund.</p>",
            "<h3>From Purchase to Delivery (Timeframe)</h3>",
            "<p>Another factor unique to travel-related businesses is the fact that travel plans, especially those that involve<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-high-volume/\" target=\"_blank\">higher prices</a>, are usually made quite a long time in advance. Having a two or three-month wait between paying $3,000 for what you anticipate will be an exciting trip and actually taking that trip means that there is much more of a chance that your excitement will wane and you\u2019ll start thinking that maybe you should have bought a new refrigerator instead. Sometimes, circumstances and priorities change, and the trip is no longer a good idea.</p>",
            "<h3>So Why Does This Matter to the Bank or Processor?</h3>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">Fraud</a>and chargebacks (even when completely reasonable) cost money for the merchant and for the bank or other payment processor. They have the potential to cost either or both a<i>lot</i>of money.</p>",
            "<p>This makes it very difficult for travel agencies, etc., to open a merchant account at<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\" target=\"_blank\">traditional banks</a>and even most payment processing companies. The application process is longer, stricter, and more complex than for businesses in industries that are not considered to be high risk. However, the reluctance of banks and other typical payment processors to deal with high-risk businesses does not change the fact that your travel-related business has to have a way for customers to pay with credit cards/debit cards.</p>",
            "<h2>What you can do</h2>",
            "<p>So, what can you, as the owner of a high risk<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-travel-merchant-account/\" target=\"_blank\">travel-related business</a>, do to overcome these obstacles? First, of course, you can implement measures to reduce or eliminate risks. For example, you can<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-strict-refund-policies-can-hurt-you/\" target=\"_blank\">reduce the likelihood of chargebacks by making return policies clear and easy to understand</a>, but providing high-quality customer service, maintaining good communication with customers, and providing refunds before customers initiate chargebacks. This won\u2019t necessarily change the fact that your business is considered to be high risk, but in the long run, it will save you money and help your business grow.</p>",
            "<p>Ultimately, you will need to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\" target=\"_blank\">find a payment processor</a>. If traditional banks won\u2019t provide services to you, you can utilize a payment processing company. The problem with that solution, however, is that most of them, such as PayPal, Stripe, and Square, are also reluctant to work with high-risk businesses, sometimes specifically because of the risks, and sometimes simply because they\u2019re not equipped to deal with the special circumstances and needs of high-risk businesses.</p>",

            "<h3>True Merchant Account Providers in the \"High-Risk\" Space</h3>",
            "<p>There are, however, payment processors that are equipped to accommodate high-risk businesses. The ideal is a payment processor that specializes in high-risk industries. There may even be some that have a solid track record in your industry.</p>",
            "<p>The payment processor should have the equipment and software to provide your customers with a payment portal and handle not only the standard aspects of payment processing but also those that are unique to your industry, as well as unexpected occurrences. It should have the ability to make sure that you will receive uninterrupted and accurate credit card payment processing.</p>",
            "<p>Be honest and open about the nature of your business. This will be a partnership of sorts, and neither you nor the payment processor will benefit from misrepresentation of what is needed, what is available, and what problems are foreseen merely to acquire a merchant account.</p>",
            "<h3>The Risk of a Standard Merchant Account Provider</h3>",
            "<p>There are other benefits as well to utilizing a high-risk payment processor. Ordinarily, high-risk merchant accounts for travel-related businesses do not utilize purchase price caps. This makes it easier for customers to make purchases. In addition, with standard merchant accounts at traditional banks, an increase in chargebacks often results in the account being closed suddenly, without warning. That leaves the business without a way to process payments, which means that the business will have no money coming in until a new merchant account can be obtained. In the case of a new business, that can be fatal.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, to a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk payment processor</a>,<a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/cas/chargback_guide.pdf\">chargebacks</a>are a given due to the nature of the travel industry, so there is a much higher tolerance for chargebacks. This means that it is unlikely that your account will be closed suddenly, without warning. Some payment processors also provide chargeback management services to fight chargebacks that you believe are illegitimate.</p>",
            "<h3>Getting Approved for a Merchant Account in the Travel-Related Business</h3>",
            "<p>Implementing measures to limit chargebacks is always a good idea, but keeping chargebacks to a minimum will do much to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/my-merchant-account-has-been-shut-down-now-what-do-i-do/\" target=\"_blank\">keep your account in good standing</a>, whether the account is at a traditional bank, with a popular payment processor, or a high-risk payment processor.</p>",
            "<p>A high-risk payment processor won\u2019t necessarily offer accounts to every high-risk business simply because it asked for one. Specializing in high-risk industries and being more willing to deal with high-risk businesses does not mean that the payment processor doesn\u2019t care about risk or doesn\u2019t take the number and degree of risks into consideration. If a high-risk payment processing company is blind to its own risks, it won\u2019t be processing payments for very long. It does, however, make it much easier for your high-risk travel business to open a merchant account.</p>"

            "<h1>How to Combat International Chargebacks</h1>",
            "<p>The advent of the Internet has made it possible even for small businesses to reach potential customers almost anywhere in the world. It does, however, bring along some risks due to the nature of online transactions as card-not-present transactions (i.e., a transaction in which neither the card nor the cardholder is physically present at the time of the transaction), the greater susceptibility to having private information intercepted at some point between the customer and the merchant, the difficulty of taking legal action when necessary, and other factors, some of which are specific to the country in question. In this article, we will tell you how to combat international chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>Despite the risks, doing business internationally can be great for your business. It is necessary, however, to understand the risks and implement measures to prevent those risks from becoming actual incidents, or at least reduce the potential, and to minimize the damage in the event that something does happen. International transactions are one of the factors that often earn a merchant the label \u201chigh-risk business.\u201d In this article, we will look at how to combat international chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>That alone can make it difficult to open a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\" target=\"_blank\">merchant account</a>at a bank, and even if you are able to open an account, subsequent incidents or changes that banks perceive as increasing the level of risk may earn you a swift termination of your processing agreement and cancelation of your account. A leading factor both in making it hard to open an account and in getting your account closed is, of course,<a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/cas/chargback_guide.pdf\">chargebacks</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The bad news is that orders placed with merchants in the U.S. from outside the country are about three times more likely to be fraudulent than those placed from inside the country. That means not only an increase in legitimate chargebacks, but in<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">fraudulent or malicious chargebacks</a>. So, when making the decision to go global, spend the time and effort to gain a good understanding of the risks and implement wise measures to protect your business. It really<i>is</i>possible to take advantage of the global market without undue or uncontrolled risk.</p>",
            "<h2>Keep an Eye on the IP Address</h2>",
            "<p>Some countries have a higher incidence of\u2014and, accordingly, a higher probability of\u2014fraud than other countries. For example, about a third of all transactions initiated from Venezuela and Indonesia are found to be fraudulent. Other countries such as Romania, South Africa, and Brazil also have double-digit fraud rates. (The countries of Scandinavia, New Zealand, and Switzerland are considered to pose the lowest risk of e-commerce fraud for U.S. online retailers.) It\u2019s important for you to do a bit of research and understand which countries tend to pose a higher risk.</p>",
            "<p>This does not necessarily mean that you can\u2019t do business with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/whats-considered-a-high-risk-merchant/\" target=\"_blank\">customers in high-risk</a>countries. It just means that you need to exercise a higher degree of caution. Always approach orders from those countries a bit skeptically. One problem that we encounter at this point is determining where the order is being placed from. The address given by the person placing the order may not be the same as the order placer\u2019s actual location. So, how do you find out where the order is coming from?</p>",
            "<p>The typical way to do that is to check the IP address from which the order was placed. If the geographic location indicated for the IP address is not consistent with the credit card billing address, you will need to do a bit more investigating, so it would be best to wait to formally confirm the order until you can review the matter manually. If the mismatched IP address is in a high-risk country, you can assume that there is a greater probability of fraud and a higher potential for illegitimate chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>There are, of course, ways for scammers to get around that, such as using proxy servers, so examining the IP address isn\u2019t necessarily a comprehensive or foolproof solution. However, you should include it in your set of \u201ctools\u201d to protect your business against fraud. It also may require you to increase your computer knowledge and learn the fundamentals of IP addresses and such. Although not particularly difficult, it does require a little studying.</p>",
            "<p>Ultimately, you may decide that the potential gains aren\u2019t worth the risk, time, effort, and expense involved to accept orders from high-risk countries. You have the option of blocking IP addresses from high-risk areas and the scammers won\u2019t see your website, to begin with. There are plenty of countries that don\u2019t pose an unreasonable level of risk.</p>",
            "<h2>Special Orders</h2>",
            "<p>Another measure that can be implemented to protect yourself from international chargebacks and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">fraud</a>it to be very cautious with special orders. Customized products are susceptible to chargebacks, since you\u2019re not merely providing the customer with standard-specification products. The customer has a specific idea of what he wants, but may not communicate it well, particularly if language differences are an issue. In the midst of his frustration at some minor difference, it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019ll think \u201cYou know, I really didn\u2019t communicate what I wanted very well.\u201d You\u2019re expending resources to create the customized product, and if it\u2019s not something that another customer will purchase, it\u2019s a straight loss for you.</p>",
            "<p>Customized products also make it easier for people to initiate unreasonable, illegitimate, or fraudulent chargebacks. That minor difference (real or not) could be used to justify a forced refund. In such cases, you could lose the income from the sale of a product that has already shipped and may not be recoverable. Adding insult to injury, you will likely also be responsible for paying any resulting fees and penalties.</p>",
            "<h2>Know The Signs</h2>",
            "<p>A great skill to develop whether you do business with people in high-risk countries or not is the ability to identify the signs of fraud. Scammers with no \u201ctell\u201d or who perform so flawlessly that there is never any evidence of their fraud are confined to the world of thriller movies and novels. Real scammers are fallible humans, and even the best will give themselves away at some point. The signs are even more evident with common, run-of-the-mill scammers. There are patterns of behavior and certain practices that are fairly reliable indications that something isn\u2019t quite right.</p>",
            "<p>Some questions you can ask as part of your examination of the situation are as follows:</p>",
            "<p>While these are not necessarily sure signs of fraud, they are worthy of caution. If there are more than one such sign, alarms and flashing lights should be going off in your head.</p>",

            "<p>Of course, extra caution and good<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\" target=\"_blank\">preventive measures</a>are not a guarantee of no international chargebacks. The reality is that, regardless of what you do, there<i>will</i>be chargebacks. It\u2019s important to work within the context of that reality to minimize risks and mitigate the negative impact of chargebacks as much as possible.</p>",
            "<p>If you are using a high-risk payment processor, you have an excellent resource to help you address these issues and implement the most effective measures efficiently.

            "<h1>Firearms Businesses and Susceptibility to Chargebacks</h1>",
            "<p>Every business that accepts credit card payments deals with chargebacks to one degree or another. That degree is affected by a variety of factors. Some of them are inherent to the industry, such as the type of product or service. Some are specific to the individual business, such as the quality of customer service. In most cases, a business\u2019s susceptibility to chargebacks is determined by some combination of the two. This is especially prevalent when it comes to firearms businesses and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">susceptibility to chargebacks</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Firearms businesses and their susceptibility to chargebacks are one of the main reasons it is considered a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-businesses-and-payment-gateways/\">high risk business</a>. The higher the susceptibility of a business to chargebacks, the higher the likelihood that the business will be considered by banks and payment processors to be high risk. This is the case with gun shops and other firearms-related businesses.</p>",
            "<p>What is it about firearms businesses that makes them more susceptible to chargebacks? What can you do to reduce that susceptibility?</p>",
            "<h2>Dissatisfaction Leads to Chargebacks With Firearms Businesses</h2>",
            "<p>Some type of dissatisfaction with the purchased product or service is often the reason that a customer wants a refund. Except in cases in which the problem is an actual defect in the product, this generally boils down to the amount of knowledge the customer has regarding the product prior to making the purchase.</p>",
            "<p>Are these shoes the right size? Does this car give me a smooth and comfortable ride? Do I look good in this hat? Part of the process of making a purchase is deciding whether or not the product or service is a good \u201cfit\u201d (whether physically or in the sense of meeting your needs). That decision is easier, and more likely to be accurate, if you are able to \u201ctry before you buy.\u201d</p>",
            "<h2>Try Before You Buy</h2>",
            "<p>Naturally, some products and services are easier to try out than others. Trying on a pair of shoes in a store is easy. Seeing how much you like a Caribbean cruise without actually buying a ticket, making a reservation, and taking the cruise is a bit more of a challenge. This is a big factor in what makes firearms and their susceptibility to chargebacks a challenge.</p>",
            "<p>The difficulty of trying out a firearm prior to buying it is probably somewhere in between. When buying a gun, especially if the intended purpose is personal protection, it\u2019s always advisable to find a way to try out a variety of sizes, calibers, models, etc., or at least the one you are leaning toward.</p>",
            "<h2>Hands-on Shopping</h2>",
            "<p>When thinking of firearms and their susceptibility to chargebacks it is important to consider specific situations. If you are at a gun shop, you can hold the gun and examine it closely. You can get a sense of how it feels in your hands. However, there can be an enormous difference between the way an empty pistol feels in your hand in a store and the way it feels when you fire it and feel the recoil.</p>",
            "<p>The way it feels changes again after you have fired a couple of hundred rounds while practicing at the range. Responsible gun ownership and use require proper training and practice, and it\u2019s unlikely that getting a sore hand every practice session will be very motivating.</p>",
            "<p>Unfortunately, that advice is not always taken, even when it\u2019s possible, and one of the results is a higher possibility that the customer will be dissatisfied with the purchase. That means a higher possibility of a chargeback.</p>",
            "<h2>Firearms are Expensive</h2>",
            "<p>Another factor is the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-volume-merchant-account/\">price</a>of firearms. Although there is a wide range of products available, including guns that are of good quality while remaining relatively affordable, a handgun of decent quality will still start at $250 to $300 new. Well-known brands such as Glock or Smith &amp; Wesson can cost much more.</p>",
            "<p>A customer might not think that a $5.00 purchase is worth the bother of requesting a refund or initiating a chargeback, but will probably be motivated more if it cost $500. Your business could be more susceptible to chargebacks if you deal in relatively expensive goods or services.</p>",
            "<p>As happens frequently in the case of high-dollar purchases of non-necessities, a $700 Sig is a good candidate for buyer\u2019s remorse, especially if you find out that junior needs braces a month after bringing home your new pistol. The quality of the product and the customer\u2019s degree of satisfaction have less to do with this than does the customer\u2019s financial situation, etc., but there are still things that you can do to lessen the likelihood of it turning into a chargeback.

            "<h2>You Bought a What?!</h2>",
            "<p>Directly related to the high price of many firearms is the fact that guns are one of those things that gets a reaction from wives that is some form of \u201cYou bought a<i>what</i>?!\u201d or \u201cYou bought<i>another</i>one?!\u201d If the customer has successfully postponed the inevitable for long enough, he may have missed the deadline for returns. That increases the risk of a chargeback. You might be better off in the end if you have some flexibility and give a refund.</p>",
            "<h2>What You Can Do</h2>",
            "<p>As with other types of business, having a clear and easy-to-understand returns/refund policy is one of the most important things that you can do to reduce the risk of chargebacks. It\u2019s also one of the easiest. Create it, post it in plenty of locations, and go over it with the customer at the time of purchase.</p>",
            "<p>Making it easy for the customer to contact you is also a good idea. You may be able to answer some questions, give some advise, or otherwise help the customer have a better experience with the purchased firearm. If you find out what the customer doesn\u2019t like about the gun he purchased, you might be able to recommend a different item and save the sale with an exchange.</p>",
            "<h2>Customer Service is the Key to Lowering Chargebacks</h2>",
            "<p>Be sure to emphasize the importance of \u201ctrying before you buy\u201d, especially in the case of first-time gun owners. Salespeople usually want to finalize the sale<i>right now,</i>while the customer has momentum in that direction, but that isn\u2019t always the best course of action in the long run. Five sales that don\u2019t end in a refund or a chargeback are better than ten that do, so be sure to have patience.</p>",
            "<p>Losing a sale today could end up giving you a long-term loyal customer who was impressed by your desire to make sure that he got exactly what he needed. Even if a customer ultimately regrets buying something, you don\u2019t want him to regret buying it from<i>you</i>.</p>"

Multiple purchases of this type can create a surge in your<strong>merchant account volume</strong>.</p>",
            "<p>The second type of high volume transaction is when there are multiple payments happening quickly. Oftentimes, small purchases in rapid succession may constitute this sort of high volume.

            "<p>Many merchants wonder, \u201cWhat should I do if stripe cancels my merchant account?\u201d Stripe has become a major payment processor in recent years. Many small businesses in particular have made use of Stripe\u2019s services to grow their operations. However, some businesses have had a more difficult time. One issue that is faced by some businesses that use traditional banks or popular payment processors is having their merchant account frozen or shut down and the funds in the account held. This issue is not unique to Stripe, but the company is a helpful case study in understanding the issue. Today, we will take a brief look at the answer to the question \u201cWhat should I do if Stripe holds my funds?\u201d</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Closed Without Warning</h2>",
            "<p>Banks and other financial institutions that provide merchant accounts to businesses can freeze or shut down your account without prior notification. It does not always happen without warning, but in many cases it does, and those cases can be extremely difficult for a business. Stripe is one payment processor that has a reputation for canceling merchant accounts without warning and without explanation.</p>",
            "<p>Many businesses have had their accounts put on probation or canceled by Stripe. Stripe notifies merchants that their accounts have been closed through an automated message that does not include an explanation of the reason for the closure. It is often unclear how to request an explanation or reinstatement of your account.</p>",
            "<p>To make matters worse, Stripe usually holds funds from the closed account to cover any chargeback fees, etc., that may be delayed in arriving. That in itself if not unreasonable. If a company has a high chargeback rate, and has unresolved cases when the account is closed, those cases and disputes remain. In that case, Stripe would have to cover those costs itself, possibly incurring a significant loss.</p>",
            "<p>However, regardless of how reasonable it may be, having a significant amount of its funds put on hold is damaging to a company, and to a small business it can be fatal.</p>",
            "<h3>Why Does Stripe Suspend or Cancel Merchant Accounts?</h3>",
            "<p>So, why was your Stripe account frozen or terminated? One of the main reasons for merchant accounts to be canceled, etc., is that the merchant is judged to be a high-risk business. Traditional banks and payment processors are usually reluctant to open a merchant account for high-risk businesses to begin with, and applies stricter requirements and criteria even when they do. High-risk businesses with accounts at traditional banks, etc., are put on a very short leash.</p>",
            "<p>Keep in mind that Stripe has the right to freeze or cancel your merchant account any time they want, and they are not required to provide you with an explanation of why it was done. In addition, even if they review your case, the statistics suggest that it is unlikely that they will rule in your favor.</p>",
            "<h2>Why Does Stripe Consider Your Business to be High Risk?</h2>",
            "<p>The reasons that Stripe may consider your business to be high risk are likely to be very similar to the reasons used by traditional banks. There are two general categories of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">high-risk business</a>, as follows.</p>",
            "<p><em>The Red Zone</em></p>",
            "<p>The \u201cRed Zone\u201d refers to businesses that are considered risky independently of their business history. Some of the factors that can put a business in the \u201cRed Zone\u201d are being in an industry that has a high risk of chargebacks, deals only with services or intangible products, deals in high-volume sales, fails frequently to comply with safety/security standards and regulations, or operates \u201cadult-oriented\u201d services (e.g., pornography, gambling, tobacco, weapons, alcohol).</p>",
            "<p><em>The Gray Zone</em></p>",
            "<p>The \u201cGrey Zone\u201d refers to businesses that are considered risky because of their actual business history. Factors that can put a business in the \u201cGrey Zone\u201d include having a bad business credit score or none at all, having a high rate of chargebacks, being an international merchant, and accepting/dealing with foreign currency.</p>",
            "<p>Not surprisingly, businesses considered to be the highest risks are those that are in both categories.</p>",
            "<p>You can find a list of types of business that are typically considered to be high risk<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\">here</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Stripe specifies the<a href=\"https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses\">types of business that it will not service</a>, so be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before utilizing their services. Doing so could save you a lot of headaches, both financial and literal.</p>",
            "<h3>What to Do if Stripe Terminates/Freezes your Merchant Account</h3>",
            "<p>If Stripe closes your account and puts the funds in the account on hold, it is important that you act quickly. Failing to do so could result in losing the funds. Contact Stripe as soon as possible to get all of the details that you can and put necessary measures into action. If you believe that the reason for closing the account is unreasonable or illegitimate, you can file an appeal. If you believe that Stripe has violated the terms and conditions and it will not resolve the matter, it may be a good idea to consult with an attorney.</p>",
            "<p>If Stripe will not reopen your account, be sure to notify any of your customers that could be affected by the closure, which could prevent them from making payments depending on the timing. You may be able to arrange for them to pay you some other way.</p>",
            "<h2>Accepting Payments Again After Your Stripe Account is Closed</h2>",
            "<p>Although Stripe usually sends you notification that you have 30 days to dispute the cancelation of your account, you need to make other arrangements for payment processing as soon as possible. The ideal is to have a backup plan already in place, at the very least knowing of other payment processors that could provide you the necessary services. Although it\u2019s possible that your Stripe account will be reinstated, a full month or more of being unable to receive payments could do serious damage to your business.</p>",
            "<p>In such cases, it would be advisable for you to consider using a high-risk payment processor. High-risk payment processors have the knowledge, experience, and resources to work with your special circumstances and needs. They also have a higher threshold for things such as chargeback rate, and can help you reduce chargebacks to begin with.</p>",
            "<p>Whether you are just now starting your high-risk business and are considering a high-risk payment processor, are contemplating a switch from a traditional bank, or are in the middle of dealing with having Stripe or another payment processor suddenly close your account, our team at<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>is ready to put its knowledge and experience to use to help your business.

The system and ACH merchant accounts are governed by the ACH Rules.</p>",
            "<p>Trillions of dollars pass through the ACH system each year. The number of ACH payments reached a record high of<a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/news/ach-network-sees-291-billion-payments-2021-led-major-gains-b2b-and-same-day-ach\">almost 29 billion</a>in 2021. That calculates to an average of about 87 ACH payments per U.S. citizen. Even if participation in the ACH system is not absolutely necessary for your business right now, it is certain that it will not be long until businesses that do not offer the option of ACH payments are at a significant disadvantage.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What is an ACH Merchant Account?</h2>",
            "<p>An ACH merchant account is similar to a traditional merchant account that process paper checks. Customers provide the same information as is included on a paper check (account holder\u2019s name, bank routing number, checking account number, and amount of the payment) The information is verified and sent through a system that is compliant with the rules and regulations for ACH, initiating an immediate transfer of funds.</p>",
            "<p>Payments can be accepted from any device that has an Internet connection. Many businesses even use ACH payment processing instead of paper checks and physical credit cards. Integrating a check reader into the ACH processing system can reduce or even eliminate the need to visit a bank and deposit checks manually.</p>",
            "<p>There are many aspects of your business where the ACH system can be useful. Ultimately, any type of payment that can be automated is a candidate. In particular, ACH merchant accounts are often used for e-billing, recurrent billing, online transactions, payments by telephone, and mobile payments.</p>",
            "<h3>What are the Benefits of an ACH Account?</h3>",
            "<p>In addition to being useful in automating and streamlining the payment processing system, an ACH merchant account has a variety of other advantages for your business and your customers. Below are a few of them.</p>",
            "<p><em>Reduced costs</em></p>",
            "<p>ACH payment processing is less expensive than paper checks, credit cards, or wire transfers. The automation and streamlining enabled by the system can also free up more of your time, providing savings in labor costs.</p>",
            "<p><em>Security</em></p>",
            "<p>Mailing paper checks creates the risk that the check will be lost. More importantly, it is vulnerable to theft and fraud, and could even lead to identity theft. With ACH payments, there is no need to mail paper checks. In addition, the customer\u2019s personal information is encrypted in ACH transactions, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft.</p>",
            "<p><em>Consistency</em></p>",
            "<p>Because much of the process is automated, and because recurring payments can be scheduled easily, customers can avoid worrying about forgetting to send payments. Your business can also avoid worrying about not receiving payments. That peace of mind and more predictable cash flow is certain to benefit both your business and your customers.</p>",
            "<p><em>Faster processing</em></p>",
            "<p>Because the time required for mailed checks to arrive is eliminated, and the necessary information is entered into the system at the time of payment, ACH payments can be processed much more quickly, often on the same day. The faster cash flow is a benefit, of course, but the faster processing means that you will know at an earlier stage when a payment has been declined, allowing you to resolve the problem before the situation worsens</p>",
            "<h2>Regulations and Operating Rules</h2>",
            "<p>When using an ACH merchant account and the ACH system, there are three sets of regulations and operating rules that you should be familiar with. These are the ACH Regulations, the Nacha Operating Rules &amp; Guidelines, and Federal Reserve Banks Operating Circular No. 4.</p>",
            "<h3>ACH Regulations</h3>",
            "<p>The main regulations for the ACH system are found in Part 210 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) (<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-210\">Federal Government Participation in the Automated Clearing House</a>). A variety of related information and resources is also available on the<a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/ach/\">official website</a>of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>",
            "<h3>Nacha Operating Rules &amp; Guidelines</h3>",
            "<p>Nacha (previously known as the National Automated Clearinghouse Association) operates the ACH Network. It is a non-profit association funded by the financial institutions that utilize the ACH Network. In that capacity, Nacha manages and oversees the rules, regulations, and standards that apply to the transfer of money between accounts at banks and other financial institutions and payment processors. Nacha has compiled those rules, etc., in the<a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/content/rules-enforcement\">Nacha Operating Rules &amp; Guidelines</a>.</p>",
            "<h3>Federal Reserve Banks Operating Circular No. 4</h3>",

            "<p>Together, the ACH Regulations, the Nacha Operating Rules &amp; Guidelines, and Federal Reserve Banks Operating Circular No. 4 establish the way that the ACH system functions and the criteria for compliance. Although it is not necessary to have a deep and detailed understanding of the contents, it\u2019s a good idea to have a general knowledge of the basics and main points.</p>",
            "<p>Using an ACH merchant account can be of particular benefit to high-risk businesses.

            "<p>In this guide, we\u2019ll tell you what you should look for in a high risk payment processor.</p>",

            "<h2>Challenges to Choosing a Payment Processor for a High-Risk Business</h2>",
            "<p>A payment processor helps to oversee credit card transactions and will function as a middleman between a business and financial institutions.</p>",
            "<p>There are many services that a payment processor may offer. This includes the ability to provide payment processing services, card acceptance equipment, help with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-navigate-pci-compliance-in-2022/\">PCI compliance</a>, security solutions, and more.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s important to realize that a payment processor can be held accountable for<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">chargebacks</a>if your business is unable to pay. This is the reason why it\u2019s important to choose a high-risk payment processor to work with.</p>",
            "<p>Because of the increased risk, your relationship with a payment processor will be a bit different than with a typical business. Costs may be higher for the services and special payment processes may be utilized.</p>",
            "<h3>Factors to Consider During Your Search</h3>",
            "<p>While there are many high-risk payment processors out there, it\u2019s important to choose one that will be reliable. Here\u2019s what you should consider when choosing a high-risk payment processor.</p>",
            "<h2>1. Know Your Risk Level</h2>",
            "<p>Before starting your search for a payment processor, you should consider the risk level of your business. Make sure that you understand your industry\u2019s specific level of risk as well as the level of chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a good idea to make a risk assessment and to carefully calculate your business\u2019s level of risk through careful analysis. This will help you determine which payment processors might be a good fit for your business and will give you a clearer idea of what you should be looking for.</p>",
            "<h3>2. Decide How You'll Process Transactions</h3>",
            "<p>You should also consider the specific payment<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/payment-gateway-for-startups/\">tools and systems</a>that you\u2019ll need access to in your business. Think carefully about how your customers will make payments and how you\u2019ll handle transactions.</p>",
            "<p>If you need a powerful point-of-sale system that is focused on your industry, your needs will be different than if you simply need to allow customers to make swipe or chip transactions at your counter.</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to think about the payment types and point-of-sale features that you need. Then, search for a payment processor accordingly.</p>",
            "<h2>3. Check Additional Features</h2>",
            "<p>It\u2019s important to consider your priorities when looking for a payment processor. Ensure that you choose a payment processor that offers any additional features and tools that you need or that prioritizes certain things.</p>",
            "<p>Some payment processors will emphasize security and fraud prevention while others will have a greater emphasis on efficiency. Some will provide superior data analytics tools.</p>",
            "<p>Make sure to consider the specific features that you\u2019re interested in and weigh out the pros and cons of each payment processor carefully.</p>",
            "<h3>4. Ask for a Client List</h3>",
            "<p>When choosing a high-risk payment processor, you should ask for a list of previous clients and references. A reliable payment processor will be happy to give you more information about previous clients and will stand by the services and support they provide.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a good idea to look for a payment provider that has served other large and successful businesses. This will usually be a good indicator that the payment processer is reliable and knows exactly what they\u2019re doing.</p>",
            "<h2>5. Understand the Pricing</h2>",
            "<p>You should also think about the cost of any payment processer you work with as well.</p>",
            "<p>There are various pricing schemes that payment processors use so you should consider the pros and cons of each of them. Flat-rate pricing and<a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/interchange-fees\">interchange-plus pricing</a>schemes are both very popular options.</p>",
            "<p>There can be a lot of transaction fees when working with a processor, so you\u2019ll want to think about the pricing carefully. Pick a payment process that offers a good cost while also verifying that the payment processor has the other qualities and features you need as well.</p>",
            "<h3>6. Consider the Reputation</h3>",
            "<p>When choosing a payment processing partner, you also need to find out everything you can about their reputation. Do some online research and search for online reviews on the company to get a better idea of how others view them.</p>",
            "<p>Checking online directory sites or websites such as Google and Facebook can allow you to read honest online reviews. This can give you a good idea of what to expect if you work with them.</p>",
            "<p>Doing so can give you a much better idea of which payment processors might be a good choice and which ones you should avoid.</p>",
            "<h2>7. Look for Easy Integration</h2>",
            "<p>One of the most important things to look for when choosing a high-risk payment processor is easy integration. You need to find out how easily the payment processor will integrate with your current systems and ensure that the process will be streamlined.</p>",
            "<p>Great integration will help you get started with your new relationship quickly and can minimize headaches. On top of this, you\u2019ll experience fewer issues and payment delays that can lead to poor customer satisfaction.</p>",
            "<h3>Using These Tips to Find a High Risk Payment Processor</h3>",
            "<p>If you want to find a high risk payment processor for your business, make sure to take a calculated approach. Look for a great reputation, a strong list of past clients, the right features, and the other factors listed above when making your choice.</p>",

There are some downsides to this (including higher fees), but it may be the best merchant account solution for your business.</p>",
            "<h3>Reasons Why Banks Consider Businesses High-Risk</h3>",
            "<p>Earlier, we touched on the fact that the vast majority of businesses in America are considered high-risk. With that in mind, what causes businesses to be considered high risk or not?</p>",
            "<p>The truth is that many different things can flag your business as \u201chigh-risk\u201d in the eyes of the bank. For example, if your products or services come with long chargeback periods, this can make banks nervous.</p>",
            "<p>Sometimes, even the reputation of your industry having long chargebacks can be a red flag. The same goes for industries that banks think might cause harm to a respectable reputation (such as businesses selling adult marital aids, tobacco, and so on).</p>",
            "<p>The bank may consider you<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\">high risk</a>if you sell very expensive products. And they will tag you as high risk if you have poor personal credit, poor business credit, or your business has a history of low sales.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s very easy for you to be labeled as a high-risk merchant. If that happens, though a high-risk merchant account may be the solution your business needs.</p>",
            "<h2>Understanding the High-Risk Merchant Account</h2>",
            "<p>If the bank has labeled your business as high risk, it doesn\u2019t mean you will be unable to use credit card processing services. You simply need to open a high-risk merchant account instead.</p>",
            "<p>Generally speaking, these are special accounts that come with higher fees. The higher fees are there to help offset the additional chargebacks that the bank is worried about.</p>",
            "<p>You can apply for a high-risk merchant account online very easily. And once you have the account, you\u2019ll have access to the merchant account solutions you need to run your business.</p>",

            "<p>Still on the fence about applying for a high-risk merchant account? To help you make your decision, we\u2019ve rounded up the biggest benefits of using these accounts.</p>",
            "<p>One of the biggest benefits is that you\u2019ll have global coverage for your business. Being able to sell goods and services to customers all over the world can really help you to expand your business. And it allows you to increase profits and boost your bottom line in a big way.</p>",
            "<p>The other big benefit of a high-risk merchant account is that you get enhanced chargeback protection. With this protection, you don\u2019t have to worry about too many chargebacks coming in and getting your account terminated for good.</p>",
            "<h2>Are There Any Drawbacks To a High-Risk Account?</h2>",
            "<p>There are some great benefits to getting a high-risk merchant account. However, there are also some drawbacks that you should be aware of.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve already covered the biggest drawback: higher fees. While no business owner likes paying fees, these fees help protect against chargebacks. As such, this is simply \u201cthe price of doing business\u201d for many companies.</p>",
            "<p>Aside from that, the only other \u201ccons\u201d mostly depend on who you do business with. For example, some merchants have to deal with high mandatory reserve accounts and annoying rolling reserves.

            "<p>You need to do your homework regarding other fees. For example, you may have penalty fees, monthly fees, and processing fees. Keep in mind that processing fees really add up, even if they don\u2019t look very big at first glance!</p>",

            "<p>The worldwide adult industry is now measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. The Internet, virtual reality, mobile communications, and other technological developments provide the industry with various new ways to continue growing. The types of business in the industry vary as well, and range from one-man businesses to large corporations. Especially considering some of the unique characteristics and challenges of doing business in the adult industry, an important first step in starting is determining how to take payments for your adult business.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What is an Adult Business?</h2>",
            "<p>What, specifically, are we talking about when we say \u201cadult business?\u201d What types of business are considered to be part of the adult industry?</p>",
            "<p>The answer is not always clear cut or consistent. Many of the applicable laws and regulations are determined by state or local governments, meaning that not only the rules, but also the definitions, may change once you step into another town or state.</p>",
            "<p>There are, however, some general characteristics that tend to be common.<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118896877\">The International Encyclopedia of Human Sexuality</a>states that \u201cadult industry generally refers to the sale of sexually explicit material or services, including legal and illegal exchanges, for profit in commercial marketplaces.\u201d For example,<a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/corona/latest/corona_ca/0-0-0-52351\">the municipal code of Corona, California</a>defines \u201cadult business\u201d as any business where employees or patrons expose specified anatomical areas or engage in specified sexual activities, or any business which offers to its patrons services or entertainment characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting, exposing, describing, discussing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.</p>",
            "<p>This does not include \u201cbona fide medical establishments operated by properly licensed and registered medical personnel with appropriate medical credentials for the treatment of patients.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Some of the most common types of legally operated business that would be included under this definition are as follows.</p>",
            "<p>There are also commercial establishments that have a main business not related to the sale or rental of descriptions or depictions of \u201cspecified anatomical areas or engage in specified sexual activities.\u201d These include live strip clubs and other adult theaters, as well as adult motels that rent rooms in hourly units rather than in day units.</p>",
            "<h3>Why are Adult Merchant Accounts High Risk?</h3>",
            "<p>Banks and credit card companies, etc., use<a href=\"https://www.citibank.com/tts/solutions/commercial-cards/assets/docs/govt/Merchant-Category-Codes.pdf\">merchant category codes</a>(MCCs) to classify businesses by the types of good or service that they sell. An MCC can be used for tax purposes, collection of information, and analyzing purchasing behavior, but they can also be used to restrict transactions or flag high-risk businesses.</p>",
            "<p>Certain MCCs are used by banks to identify adult businesses. One of the most common is<a href=\"https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/mccom/en-us/documents/rules/quick-reference-booklet-merchant-edition.pdf\">MCC 5967</a>, which identifies businesses that provide adult chat and entertainment, among other businesses.</p>",
            "<p>What is it that makes banks and other financial institutions view the adult industry as high risk? The two most common reasons that a company is labeled \u201chigh-risk business\u201d are a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">high chargeback rate</a>and a high frequency of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\">fraud</a>. These both apply to the adult industry overall, so having your business categorized as MCC 5967 alone could result in the bank rejecting your application for a merchant account.</p>",
            "<h2>Chargebacks and Fraud</h2>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">Chargebacks</a>are an issue for just about every business, whether high risk or low risk. However, there are aspects of the adult industry that can lead to a higher rate of chargebacks than other industries. One is that customers of adult businesses usually don\u2019t want others to know about their purchases. If the purchase is discovered, they might deny making the purchase in order to save face. That can result in a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>In some cases, credit card information really is stolen and used to buy goods or services from an adult business. If the cardholder doesn\u2019t notice the charge soon, the loss can be significant. There are also cases in which a family member has used the card without permission, and not wanting to get in trouble, denies it when asked. The cardholder assumes that the card information has been stolen, and might initiate a chargeback. This type of unintentional fraud is called \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/friendly-fraud/\">friendly fraud</a>.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>\u201cFriendly\u201d or not, it can cause a lot of problems and loss for everyone involved. It\u2019s not exclusive to the adult industry, of course, but the higher likelihood that the guilty family member, etc., will be extra secretive means that there is a higher degree of motivation to deny making the purchase in the case of the adult industry.</p>",
            "<h3>Laws and Regulations for Adult Businesses</h3>",
            "<p>The adult industry also has a more challenging legal standing. One of these is the lack of uniformity in applicable laws and regulations between states and municipalities that was mentioned earlier. Another is that there are often legal requirements and restrictions placed on businesses in the industry that are not placed on businesses in other industries. Compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards has become a pressing issue in every industry, and the United States is especially strict toward the adult industry.</p>",
            "<p>Some of the requirements may even be somewhat unexpected. For example, the U.S. Code includes requirements for record-keeping related to simulated sexual conduct (<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2257A\">U.S. Code \u00a7 2257A</a>).</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to look into the relevant laws and regulations thoroughly and make<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-navigate-pci-compliance-in-2022/\">compliance</a>a priority in your business. Your high-risk payment processor should be able to help you with this, so if you are unsure, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. Our team at Zen Payments will be glad to help you.</p>",
            "<h2>It\u2019s Difficult for Adult Businesses to Take Payments</h2>",

Even with customers ready to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on your products and services, you\u2019re not going to see any of it if you can\u2019t even open a merchant account, let alone process payments.</p>",
            "<p>Even if you are able to convince a bank to open a merchant account for your business, a tiny increase in the number of chargebacks could get your account shut down without warning. The complex, inconsistent, and frequently changing laws and regulations in the adult industry could even get your business itself shut down.</p>",
            "<p>There is certainly a high degree of potential for your business to prosper in the industry, but in a sense, you have to cross a minefield to get to it.</p>",

The aggregate merchant account provider makes special exceptions for the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-volume-merchant-account/\">high-volume</a>adult content provider. In the past, card companies like Visa and Mastercard have cracked down on the industry.

OnlyFans currently has around 1.5 million creators and over 170 million registered subscribers. With numbers like these, it takes a great deal of internal resources to monitor, and correct illicit behavior.</p>",

            "<p>The<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\">chargeback</a>rates for adult content are historically very high for reasons that seem quite common. Some customers make clandestine transactions and later realize the charge shows up on their credit card statement. To delete the transaction altogether they file for a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">chargeback</a>which ends up as a relinquished payment.</p>",
            "<p>Additionally, chargebacks occur as a result of a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/credit-card-processing-for-continuity-subscription-merchants/\">subscription billing model</a>. This type of payment is billed automatically over time, usually weekly or monthly. As such, customers often forget about the payment when it\u2019s left on autopilot. When they see it later on their statement they cancel and in many cases dispute the charge if the merchant doesn\u2019t offer a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-strict-refund-policies-can-hurt-you/\">refund</a>.</p>",
            "<h2>Payment Processing For Your Adult Site</h2>",

Altogether, this is the set of rules that keep card data secure so consumers can feel confident making transactions with credit and debit cards.</p>",
            "<h2>What Is The Meaning of PCI Compliance?</h2>",
            "<p>PCI compliance means your company follows the standards in place to protect cardholder data. These standards are set by the<a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/\"><b>PCI Security Standards Council</b></a>. This group was created in 2006 when card brands combined to refine the systems in place for security and protection.</p>",
            "<p>The Council makes the guidelines that businesses need to follow in order to obtain the compliant status. It\u2019s the card brands like Visa, American Express, and Mastercard that ultimately enforce these regulations so people and businesses can trust their purchasing methods and online transactions.</p>",
            "<h2>Who Is Required To Be PCI Compliant?</h2>",
            "<p>All companies that read, transmit or store cardholder data are required to be<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-businesses-and-payment-gateways/\"><b>PCI compliant</b></a>. If not, you will be charged from $10 \u2013 $100 per month.</p>",
            "<h3>Third-Party Processors</h3>",
            "<p>Organizations who use third party payments operators should still maintain PCI compliance. This is because they still have essential customer information passing through their payment channels.</p>",

            "<h3>Who Needs One?</h3>",
            "<p>Any business that wants to accept credit card payments needs to use a payment processing company. This is true for both online businesses and brick-and-mortar businesses.

That\u2019s why there are a few things you should keep in mind when choosing a payment processing company.</p>",
            "<p>Here are a few tips:</p>",
            "<h3>Professional Reputation</h3>",
            "<p>Make sure the company is professional. This means that they should have a good reputation and provide you with good customer service.</p>",
            "<h3>Competitive Rates</h3>",
            "<p>Make sure the company offers competitive rates. You don\u2019t want to overpay for card processing services.</p>",
            "<h3>Reliable Service</h3>",
            "<p>Choose a company that is known for being timely. You don\u2019t want to have to worry about your credit card processing service going down or being unreliable.</p>",
            "<h3>Good Customer Service</h3>",
            "<p>Make sure the company you choose has good customer service. You should be able to easily get in touch with someone if you have any questions or problems.</p>",
            "<h3>Flexible Terms</h3>",
            "<p>Look for a company that is flexible and willing to work with you on terms. You should be able to negotiate a contract that works for both of you.</p>",
            "<h3>Top Security Features</h3>",
            "<p>Make sure the company offers good security features. This is important because you want to protect your business from<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-1/\">fraud</a>.</p>",
            "<h2>Tips for Learning About a Company's Reputation</h2>",
            "<p>One way to verify a company\u2019s reputation is to check with the Better Business Bureau. The BBB will have information on any complaints filed against the company. Their website also has a lot of<a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/article/business/26850-bbb-business-tip-20-business-and-finance-terms-you-should-know\">free resources</a>for business owners that can help you fine-tune your practices.</p>",
            "<p>You can also ask for recommendations from friends and family. If someone you trust has had a good experience with a company, then it is likely that you will too. Referrals are always a safe way to choose a company to work with since you\u2019ll have a first-hand report.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also wise to verify the company\u2019s online presence. Do they have a user-friendly website and active blog?</p>",
            "<p>If the company has an up-to-date online presence, it\u2019s a sign you\u2019re on the right path. Next, you\u2019ll want to verify their customer service abilities.</p>",
            "<p>After all, you deserve quality care and expert help throughout the entire setup.<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">Do they have experience</a>providing payments specifically for credit cards? It\u2019s especially helpful if they\u2019re familiar with setting up payment systems for your industry.</p>",
            "<h2>Signs of Good Customer Service</h2>",
            "<p>Quality customer service is essential when choosing a credit card processing company. You should always feel heard and valued by the company, and they should always deliver on their promises.</p>",
            "<p>Before committing to a plan, perform a bit of online search. Then contact the company directly and ask them questions. See how long it takes them to respond and how helpful they are.</p>",
            "<p>If they\u2019re not responsive or helpful, that\u2019s another red flag. Once they answer the phone, take your time asking questions. Only move forward when you feel you\u2019ve covered every base, including payment terms.</p>",
            "<h2>Protect Your Company From Start to Finish</h2>",
            "<p>In short, take some time to research the credit card processing company you\u2019re considering. It could save you a lot of headaches down the road!</p>",

            "<h1>Why Are Nutraceutical Merchant Accounts High Risk?</h1>",
            "<p>Recent studies indicate that<a href=\"https://www.crnusa.org/resources/consumer-intelligence-enhance-business-outcomes\">80% of all Americans use dietary supplements</a>.<a href=\"https://www.crnusa.org/resources/2020-crn-consumer-survey-dietary-supplements\">By category</a>, 98% use vitamin/mineral supplements, 46% use special supplements, 44% use herbals/botanicals, 30% use supplements for sports nutrition, and 19% use them for weight management. The global nutraceutical market reached $289.8 billion in 2021, and is expected to<a href=\"https://www.bccresearch.com/market-research/food-and-beverage/nutraceuticals-global-markets.html\">reach $438.9 billion by 2026</a>. Despite being a massive and growing industry, traditional banks and payment processors tend to be reluctant to provide merchant accounts and related services to such businesses. To address that problem, we first need to ask: Why are nutraceutical merchant accounts high risk?</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>The Unclear Position of Nutraceuticals</h2>",
            "<p>The problem begins with the categorization of nutraceutical products. Many people don\u2019t understand the difference between pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, or even know that there<em>is</em>a difference. In general, though, pharmaceuticals are chemicals and combinations of chemicals are created through a process of research and development and undergo a series of clinical trials. In most cases, they are intended to be used to treat specific diseases.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, nutraceuticals are food-based substances, meaning that they consist of one or more naturally occurring substance, with herbs being the most well-known. Whereas pharmaceuticals are almost always used for the treatment of diseases, nutraceuticals are used for the<a href=\"https://jbkwellnesslabs.com/blog/nutraceuticals-vs-pharmaceuticals/\">prevention<em>and</em>treatment of diseases</a>, as well as to improve the health of individuals who aren\u2019t suffering from any particular disease.</p>",
            "<p>One implication of this is that nutraceuticals include a wide variety of substances with a wide variety of legal standing. Because pharmaceuticals tend to be more clearly defined, pharmacies are usually regulated by state pharmacy boards. The regulatory authority for nutraceuticals, however, is rather unclear. The wide range of products ultimately means that a single nutraceuticals merchant may have to deal with multiple agencies, sets of laws and regulations, and other requirements.</p>",
            "<h3>Health and Safety Issues</h3>",
            "<p>Because nutraceutical products affect the human body, there are various health and safety risks involved in their sale and distribution. That brings additional regulatory issues into the picture, as well as the risk of liability for physical harm, or in the worst-case scenario, death. The unclear legal standing of nutraceuticals makes liability in such cases difficult to predict as well.</p>",
            "<p>Because of this, there are more angles from which the merchant can be hit with legal issues. That increases the risk of financial problems, bankruptcy, and other problems that cause financial loss to banks providing merchant accounts.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Why are nutraceutical merchant accounts considered high risk?\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dreamstime_s_48946247.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Chargebacks</h2>",
            "<p>A variety of factors result in a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\">high chargeback rate</a>in the nutraceutical industry. One is the unclear definition and categorization of nutraceuticals mentioned above. On one hand, if the merchant makes very specific claims about a product, and a customer believes that the product did not live up to those claims, that dissatisfaction could motivate the customer to initiate a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">chargeback</a>. Less honest customers could even use an excessively strict interpretation of the merchant\u2019s claim to say that the product was not as promised.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, if the merchant makes only very general claims about the product, there is more room for customers to expect unrealistic results or to use the product for something outside its intended use. In either case, the customer will believe that the product failed to do what it was supposed to do and demand a refund. In this case as well, dishonest customers could use the ambiguity to make<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-2/\">fraudulent</a>claims.</p>",
            "<h3>Minimizing Chargeback Risk</h3>",
            "<p>One of the best ways to minimize this risk is for merchants to manage the customer\u2019s expectations. That means making it clear what you claim about the product<em>and</em>what you do not claim. Unlike a mechanical device, it is impossible to predict exactly what effect herbs and nutritional substances, etc., will have on a specific individual in a specific situation. This is true even of pharmaceutical products that have undergone extensive clinical testing.</p>",
            "<p>Making what customers should<em>not</em>expect particularly clear may discourage some customers from buying the product, but those customers are more likely to initiate chargebacks and cost the merchant more than the loss of the sale, so it may be the wisest course of action to begin with.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Nutraceuticals are a high risk business type\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dreamstime_s_134773011.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Brick-and-mortar stores must deal with the risk of fraud, of course, but it\u2019s more of an issue for online merchants. There is a higher degree of anonymity, and it is easier to use credit card information that was obtained illegally. Unauthorized use of credit cards is much more difficult to detect online than when the physical card is presented in a face-to-face transaction.</p>",
            "<p>Along with the risk of chargebacks for legitimate reasons, there is a risk of chargeback fraud. In some cases, it is a planned and intentional act of fraud, but in other cases it may be something like \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/friendly-fraud/\">friendly fraud</a>.\u201d Nutraceutical merchants that are doing well have a high volume of sales, which naturally creates more opportunities for chargebacks, fraud, and other problems to occur. That means more risk, to your business and to the bank providing the merchant account.</p>",
            "<h3>Subscriptions</h3>",
            "<p>In some cases, nutraceutical product merchants utilize a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/credit-card-processing-for-continuity-subscription-merchants/\">subscription billing model</a>. It has been reported that Visa and MasterCard have indicated that the average decline rate for in-person transactions with the physical card present is only 1.4%. On the other hand, the average decline rate when the same customer uses the same card for an online purchase, including recurring credit card payments, is about 15%. In some cases, the rate is twice that. In most cases, the business is not able to get new credit card information from the customer after a card has been declined.</p>",
            "<p>For these and other reasons,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/are-subscription-merchant-accounts-considered-high-risk/\">subscription merchant accounts</a>are considered by traditional banks and payment processors to be<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/are-subscription-merchant-accounts-considered-high-risk/\">high risk</a>. When all the above factors are taken into consideration, it isn\u2019t really that surprising that nutraceutical businesses and merchant accounts are viewed as high risk.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Neutraceuticals are a high risk business even if they don't seem like it at first\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dreamstime_s_179855057.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Lowering the Barrier to Merchant Accounts</h2>",
            "<p>So, what can you do to make it possible to get a merchant account for your nutraceutical business? What can you do to keep that merchant account after you have opened it?</p>",
            "<p>First, there are a variety of things that can be done to lower chargeback rates, regardless of the industry. You can read about some of them<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">here</a>. There are also measures to prevent or at least<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-2/\">minimize the risk of fraud</a>. Reducing chargebacks alone will likely go a long way toward making it easier to get and keep a merchant account.</p>",
            "<p>There are also things that are more specific to the nutraceuticals industry, the foremost of which is accreditation and certification.</p>",
            "<h3>Accreditation and Certification</h3>",
            "<p>The main certification organization for nutraceuticals and other areas of the healthcare market is LegitScript. LegitScript certifies merchants and providers in the healthcare market, and informs \u201cbusinesses, governments, and the public about which commercial entities are legitimate, legal, and trustworthy \u2014<a href=\"https://www.legitscript.com/certification/\">and which are not</a>.\u201d Acquiring LegitScript\u2019s stamp of approval is a significant step toward reassuring banks and payment processors that your business is less of a risk.</p>",
            "<p>Although more directly related to pharmaceuticals,<a href=\"http://fbaum.unc.edu/lobby/044_Internet_Prescriptions/Organizational_Statements/NABP/NABP_FAQ.htm\">Digital Pharmacy Accreditation</a>(DCA; formerly Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS)) is another accreditation organization that may be helpful to your business, depending on the specific areas of nutraceuticals you sell. Operated by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP), DCA identifies online pharmacy sites that are properly licensed and operating legitimately on the Internet. This makes it possible to identify websites that sell counterfeit and dangerous medicine, etc., as well.</p>",
            "<p>DCA involves rigorous reviews of policies and procedures and an on-site inspection. Nearly half of the states in the U.S. require DCA certification, but whether the states in which you operate your business require it or not, it is a sign to your customers and to banks that you pose less of a risk. Having both LegitScript and DCA accreditation (if applicable) makes your case even stronger. Even aside from the importance of accreditation, the requirements and guidelines of both organizations can be very helpful in making your business stronger.</p>",

            "<p>Even if a traditional bank is willing to provide you with a merchant account, the fact that it considers your business to be high risk does not change.

            "<p>Revenue in the travel and tourism industry is<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/travel-tourism/united-states\">expected to reach $175.4 billion in 2022</a>. The market was down significantly at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, but figures are already returning to pre-COVID-19 levels, even with restrictions remaining in place in much of the world. There is room for growth in the market. There are also some challenges that are faced by high-risk businesses, including travel businesses. One is making arrangements for credit card payment processing. Following are some tips for getting your travel business a merchant account.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What Makes Travel Businesses High Risk?</h2>",
            "<p>There are a variety of reasons that traditional banks believe that travel businesses are<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\">high risk</a>, and are therefore reluctant to provide merchant accounts to those businesses. In general, the main reasons are<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">common to most high-risk businesses</a>. Two of the most common are chargebacks and fraud. Certain factors make travel businesses particularly susceptible to these risks.</p>",
            "<p><strong><em>Chargebacks</em></strong></p>",
            "<p>As you are likely aware, chargebacks occur when a customer demands a refund of money spent on a purchase, and contacts the bank directly to reverse the relevant credit card charge. Typically, the customer either claims that the product or service was not as promised or that he or she did not make the purchase and that the card or the card number was used<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\">illegally by an unauthorized person</a>.</p>",
            "<p>In the travel industry, however, chargebacks are more often due to a customer changing his or her mind, or feeling \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse.\u201d Buyer\u2019s remorse is more likely to occur when the customer has bought something for a large amount of money than in the case of a purchase of $5.00, for example. If the customer is dissatisfied with the product or service, but it didn\u2019t cost much, he or she may not feel that the time and effort to get a refund is worth it. Travel businesses handle airline tickets, hotel booking, reservation services, and trip planning, so they deal in higher amounts per transaction, making chargebacks more likely.</p>",
            "<p><strong><em>Fraud</em></strong></p>",
            "<p>As with chargebacks, fraud (including chargeback fraud) usually occurs with purchases that have a higher price. The possibility of getting a payout of $5.00 isn\u2019t worth the risk of being sent to prison for most criminals. In addition to the higher transaction prices, travel-related business is increasingly being conducted via the Internet. The anonymity and inability to check the physical card and other factors mean that online transactions present more opportunities for fraud. If parties in multiple countries are involved, the risks increase even more.</p>",
            "<p>Fraud and chargebacks (even when completely reasonable) cause problems for the merchant and for the bank or other payment processor, and have the potential to cost either or both a<em>lot</em>of money.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Learn how to operate a high risk travel merchant account\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dreamstime_s_61275143.jpg\"/>",
            "<h3>Mitigating Chargebacks and Fraud</h3>",
            "<p>Naturally, this makes it very difficult for travel agencies, etc., to open a merchant account at a traditional bank. Even when the bank is willing to provide a high-risk business with a merchant account, the application process is longer, stricter, and more complex than for businesses in industries that are not considered to be<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">high risk</a>. Usually, the bank will impose lower limits on the business\u2019 chargeback rate, and have a lighter trigger on closing the account if the rate is higher than the set limit, even slightly.</p>",
            "<p>Because<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/rapid-dispute-resolution/\">chargebacks</a>and fraud are the most common reasons for being denied a merchant account or having it closed, that is likely<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\">where you should begin</a>. You can reduce non-fraudulent<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/rapid-dispute-resolution/\">chargebacks</a>by ensuring that your customers understand what exactly they are purchasing and what fees, etc., are included in the final total, and by having a refund policy that is both reasonable (or even somewhat generous) and easy to understand. In the long run, it will be worth it to spend a little extra time making sure that the customer understands.</p>",
            "<h2>Clarity and Communication are Your Allies</h2>",
            "<p>Giving customers more time to make a decision about the purchase may sometimes result in a decision not to make the purchase. However, a decision made in haste or on impulse is significantly more likely to result in a chargeback and the accompanying extra cost than one that is made after more thought. Travel plans are often made far in advance, possibly months before the actual trip. That gives the customer a<em>lot</em>of time to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\">develop buyer\u2019s remorse and initiate a chargeback</a>.</p>",
            "<p>A reasonable and clear refund policy will not only help your case in a dispute, but it will also increase the likelihood that the customer will go to you to request a refund rather than going directly to the bank to initiate a chargeback. The more comfortable the customer is with you and the more confidence the customer has that you will address their concerns to their satisfaction, the more likely it is that you can avoid a chargeback. A positive experience with your business may even convince the customer to stick with the purchase, or come back to you in the future to make a purchase that he or she is more sure of.</p>",
            "<p>These measures can also help prevent<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-1/\">fraud</a>. Fraudsters thrive in anonymity and love ambiguity. When terms, conditions, requirements, and procedures are spelled out clearly, fraudsters will have less leeway, and therefore fewer places to hide. Making the process easier for your legitimate customers can at the same time make things more difficult for<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">fraudsters</a>. As with criminals in general, fraudsters prefer a safe and easy path, and more often than not will abandon their plans if it seems like too much of a bother and too much of a risk.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Learn how hotels and other travel booking agencies are considered high risk\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dreamstime_s_90261242.jpg\"/>",
            "<h3>High-risk Payment Processors</h3>",
            "<p>There is a good chance that you are reading this right now because you have already been unsuccessful at getting a merchant account at a traditional bank or<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">payment processor</a>. If that\u2019s the case, a high-risk payment processor is probably what you need. Because high-risk payment processors specialize in providing services to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">high-risk industries</a>, they have the knowledge and experience to help your business get and keep a merchant account.</p>",
            "<p>To a high-risk payment processor, chargebacks are a given due to the nature of the travel industry, so there is a much higher tolerance for chargebacks. This means that it is unlikely that your account will be closed suddenly, without warning. Some payment processors also provide chargeback management services to fight chargebacks that you believe are illegitimate.</p>",
            "<p>Traditional banks often set purchase price caps as a way to mitigate their own risk. Although that is understandable to a certain degree, the problem is that it can make it difficult for your customers to make purchases. One benefit of utilizing a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\">high-risk payment</a>processor is that high-risk merchant accounts for travel-related businesses usually do not utilize purchase price caps. Naturally, this makes it easier for your customers to make purchases.</p>",
            "<h3>A Better Choice to Begin With</h3>",
            "<p>As mentioned, you may be able to find a traditional bank that is willing to provide your business with a merchant account. Even then, however, the bank will still see your business as high risk. The bank will set higher requirements to keep the account. For example, the maximum chargeback rate will be lower than for other industries. \u201cSuccess\u201d at convincing a bank to provide you with a merchant account may end up not seeming like much of an advantage. If your business is in a high-risk industry, your business might benefit from<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\">using a high-risk payment processor from the start</a>.</p>",

            "<p>If you<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-ecommerce/\">get a processing system</a>that integrates into your other systems, you\u2019ll get reports that update you at the moment, see how much money you have available and make better operating decisions when you have a more accurate business.</p>",
            "<h3>Save Time</h3>",
            "<p>One of the biggest benefits is that when the system is integrated, you\u2019ll save hours, which is very essential for small businesses. You won\u2019t have to manually enter any credit card information into your software. If you\u2019re doing a lot of transactions each day, this could take up a lot of time that you could spend growing your business.</p>",
            "<p>You won\u2019t have to manually input all the details of the transaction, and all of the information will go into the ERP system. If you have accounting software, then it will integrate into that as well.</p>",
            "<p>The transaction information will transfer right to your software without having any human interaction. This way, you can even use your employee\u2019s time to do something else, like provide a better customer experience and grow your revenue.</p>",

            "<h2>Lower Costs</h2>",
            "<p>Overall, having the right system will help lower costs as well. The payments will automatically sync when a customer makes them, and you won\u2019t have to hire an employee who is just managing your dedicated accounts receivable.</p>",
            "<p>The<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">integration</a>will reduce the cost you need to train your staff on how to process the payments or on how to enter data from all the transactions.</p>",
            "<p>Overall, the entire system will make it easier and less complicated as well.</p>",
            "<h3>Reduce Errors</h3>",
            "<p>When you don\u2019t have to manually enter the data, then you will have fewer human errors as well. Your employees might enter the data incorrectly, make double entries, put in the wrong amounts, or forget to enter a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/aggregate-merchant-account/\">transaction</a>.</p>",
            "<p>These mistakes can be changed retroactively, but they can take up a lot of your business\u2019s time and money. But when you have a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/why-use-an-iso-for-credit-card-processing/\">card processing system</a>, the payments will go through your accounting software and be entered automatically.</p>",
            "<p>While mistakes could still happen, they are very rare and are more reliable than having a human employee enter them in.</p>",
            "<h2>More Security</h2>",
            "<p>Since you\u2019re dealing with sensitive customer data, you\u2019ll want to make sure that their payment details are always safe. You should try and find a payment processor that uses a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-navigate-pci-compliance-in-2022/\">PCI-certified</a>payment processor.</p>",
            "<p>Most of the processing tools will also use tokenization. This is when the customer\u2019s card information turns into a token. Instead of saving all of the important card details, the token is saved, and only a bank can decrypt the information to complete the payment.</p>",
            "<p>The ERP system will create these tokens, and you\u2019ll be able to process payments without keeping the credit card information on file. You\u2019ll be able to keep your customer\u2019s data safe, making them feel confident in your business practices, and improving your customer retention rates as well.</p>",
            "<p>You also won\u2019t have to ask your customers for their credit card information each time you need to take a payment from them.</p>",

            "<p>Keep in mind that these payment options are also changing quickly, and you\u2019ll want to choose one that will help you stay ahead of the game. Once you get a full-service payment processor, you\u2019ll be able to operate with businesses for every growth stage.</p>",
            "<p>Many third-party services will also bundle or resell payment processors that are meant for small businesses. However, if you choose one of these options, make sure that they also offer flexibility so that you can add more options if your business grows.</p>",

            "<h1>The Three Steps to Credit Card Processing</h1>",
            "<p>Most businesses today accept credit/debit card payments. Consumers use them as a normal and natural part of daily life. It was still fairly common a generation ago for businesses to refuse the use of credit cards. Today, you\u2019re more likely to get a look of surprise if you tell a cashier that you\u2019ll pay in cash. In spite of this, credit card processing is a mystery to many people. Because accepting credit card payments involves a certain amount of risk that needs to be addressed, it\u2019s important for businesses to have at least an overall knowledge of what\u2019s involved.</p>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/credit-card-processing-how-it-works/\">Credit card processing</a>can be divided into three basic steps: authorization, authentication, and settlement. Let\u2019s take a brief look at each. (There may be slight differences in processing between transactions made in person at a shop, etc., and transactions made online, but the basic steps are generally the same.)</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Authorization</h2>",
            "<p>When you swipe (or tap/insert) your credit card in a card machine at a store or other business, or enter your card information in the case of online purchases, the card information and details of the transaction are encrypted and sent to the merchant\u2019s bank (the acquiring bank). The acquiring bank then forwards the information to the applicable<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-card-association.asp\">card association</a>(e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, etc.) with a request for authorization. From there, the information is sent to the bank that issued the card. The final step in authorization (the decision to approve or decline use of the card for the transaction) is conducted by that bank.</p>",
            "<h3>Authentication</h3>",
            "<p>Authentication is the process of verifying that the credit card used in a transaction is the real thing and is being used by an authorized user. Strictly speaking, authentication is part of authorization. However, the elements of authentication are important enough\u2014and authentication is, in fact, the core element of the approval process\u2014that viewing it as a separate step may be helpful.</p>",
            "<p>When the bank that issued the card receives the card/transaction information, it compares that information to its own records to ensure that the two sets of information match. The issuing bank also confirms that the cardholder has enough available credit to cover the purchase and that there are no restrictions on the cardholder. If a debit card is used, the bank confirms that the balance in the cardholder\u2019s account will cover the purchase. If there are no problems, the bank approves use of the card for the transaction. If there is a problem, the bank declines use of the card.</p>",
            "<p>The issuing bank sends its judgment (approve or decline) to the card association, which then forwards it to the merchant\u2019s credit card machine (or website, etc., in the case of online transactions). The judgment will be displayed to the customer and merchant, and if the card has been approved, the cardholder can finalize the purchase. The transaction must be finalized while the response code is stored in the merchant\u2019s machine or system. If there is too much of a delay, it may be necessary to redo the transaction.</p>",
            "<p>That all sounds like a lot, but because it is done electronically and most of it is automated in the system, it is an almost instantaneous process that is limited only by the speed of the servers and the network. In most cases, it takes only a few seconds.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Mobile Credit Card Processing\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mobile-Credit-Card-Processing.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Settlement</h2>",
            "<p>Settlement is the final step of credit card processing. Put simply, it is the process of transferring funds from the cardholder\u2019s account to the merchant\u2019s account. However, behind that simple step is quite a bit of interaction between the merchant, the acquiring bank, the card association, and the issuing bank. It is also the step in which processing fees are charged to the merchant.</p>",
            "<p>The credit card transactions that have been approved are stored in the merchant\u2019s system, and at a certain point (usually the close of business that day), the information is all sent to the acquiring bank in a single batch.</p>",
            "<p>The acquiring bank\u2019s system does two things at this point. First, it confirms each authorization, groups them into batches for individual issuing banks, and sends the batches to the appropriate banks via the card association. It may be helpful to think of this as a request from the merchant\u2019s bank to the customer\u2019s bank for payment.</p>",
            "<p>The acquiring bank\u2019s system also deposits the purchase amount into the merchant\u2019s account, after first subtracting processing fees, if applicable. If this occurs before the customer\u2019s bank has sent the payment to the merchant\u2019s bank, the acquiring bank is actually assuming a certain amount of risk, since it is possible (although uncommon) that the customer\u2019s bank will not make the payment or that payment will be delayed more than normal.</p>",
            "<h2>How Long Does Settlement Take?</h2>",
            "<p>The issuing bank sends the payment to the card association, which in turn debits the issuing bank the applicable amount and credits the acquiring bank. The role of the card association is similar to that of a central processing unit in a computer, in that it receives requests, notifications, payments, responses, etc., from various sources and routes them to the appropriate destination.</p>",
            "<p>The funds are usually taken from the cardholder\u2019s account automatically in the case of a debit card, but in the case of a credit card, the cardholder is typically billed for the relevant amount (including fees and interest, if applicable) and pays the issuing bank at a later date. Although the bulk of the process is conducted electronically, it may take<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/how-to-accept-credit-card-payments/\">one to three business days</a>for the transaction to be reflected in all of the accounts that are involved.</p>",
            "<p>If there are no problems or restrictions, and the acquiring bank\u2019s system deposits the purchase amount into the merchant\u2019s account at the time it sends the information to the issuing bank via the card association, the merchant will receive payment fairly quickly. However, in the case of a high-risk business, the bank may set restrictions and not deposit funds into the merchant\u2019s account until it has received payment from the issuing bank. Contact your bank or payment processor to find out what rules and regulations are in place.</p>",

            "<h1>Finding the Right Credit Card Processor for Your Gun Shop</h1>",
            "<p>Finding the right credit card processor for your gun shop is a must! The ability to accept payments from customers safely, smoothly, and reliably is not only a requirement for operating a business, but also something that can encourage purchases, motivate customers to buy something from you again in the future, and spark some word-of-mouth advertising for your business. This is true for every business, but firearms merchants and other high-risk businesses face some additional challenges that are directly or indirectly related to payment processing. Today, firearms sales usually involve payment by credit card, so let\u2019s take a brief look at finding the right credit card processor for your gun shop.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>General Requirements for High-risk Payment Processors</h2>",
            "<p>There are, of course, certain things that you should always look for in<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">a high-risk payment processor</a>, things to keep in</p>",
            "<p>mind, and questions that you should always be sure to ask. These include things such as knowing<em>how</em>high risk your high-risk business is considered to be, deciding how you want to process transactions, finding out what additional features and services are provided or available, asking for a client list to help you get an understanding of the processor\u2019s experience and consider the processor\u2019s reputation, getting a clear understanding of the pricing of services, and looking for easy integration of the processor\u2019s system and services with your existing systems.</p>",
            "<p>Another important matter in finding a credit card processor for Your gun shop is the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-businesses-and-payment-gateways/\">payment gateway</a>. As mentioned above, it is important for transactions to be both secure and pleasant (or at least not excessively painful). The payment gateway plays an important role in both of these aspects. Your aim should be to find the right balance between making it easy for customers to make a purchase on one hand and discouraging/preventing chargebacks and fraud on the other. You should be able to work with your payment processor to find the best way to do that given your specific circumstances and the characteristics of your industry and market.</p>",
            "<h2>Susceptibility to Chargebacks</h2>",
            "<p>One of the main things that makes firearms dealers high risk is their particularly high susceptibility to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">chargebacks</a>. As discussed in more detail in a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/firearms-businesses-and-susceptibility-to-chargebacks/\">different article</a>, there are generally five characteristics of firearms retail businesses that increase the risk of chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>This includes actual defects in the product, but it often is simply that the customer realized that the firearm he or she purchased thinking that it fit their criteria isn\u2019t actually a good fit. With firearms, it could literally be the way the gun fits in the hand or against the shoulder, but it could also be the strength of the recoil when the gun is fired or the weight and balance of the gun. The less experience/knowledge the customer has prior to making the purchase, the more likely the customer will be dissatisfied later on.</p>",
            "<p>Some products and services are easier to try out than others, such as trying on a pair of shoes in a store vs. sitting in a travel agency trying to imagine if a certain cruise will be what you want. Firearms are somewhere in the middle. It\u2019s usually possible to hold and handle a gun in a shop, and many gun shops have shooting ranges with a lineup of rental firearms that are the same models as those sold in the shop. Sometimes a customer has a friend or family member that owns the model, caliber, etc., that the customer is considering and can let the customer try it out. That isn\u2019t always the case, however, and in most cases, the customer\u2019s experience with the firearm prior to purchase is very limited.</p>",
            "<p>In addition to the availability of opportunities to try a firearm before you buy, various factors can lead to an inaccurate impression. For example, while it is true that you can hold a gun and examine it closely at a gun shop, there can be a significant difference in weight and balance between a pistol with an empty magazine and one with a full magazine. That difference increases more rapidly as the caliber of the gun, and therefore the weight of the ammunition, increases.</p>",
            "<p>Also, an empty .44 Magnum revolver may be a little heavy, but the physical impact is completely different when Harry Callahan\u2019s sidearm of choice is actually fired. Unfortunately, customers don\u2019t always heed advice to spend enough time using a gun before buying it, so there is a higher risk of changed minds and chargebacks at some point down the road.</p>",
            "<p>Today, there is a wide variety of quality firearms available at relatively affordable prices. However, we are still talking about a purchase of at least $200 or $300 new, with some of the well-known brands costing much more. Customers are significantly more likely to demand a refund or initiate a chargeback for a purchase of $500 than a purchase of just $5.00. Firearms fall more often into the former category than the latter, and so are more likely to result in a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>Finally, a husband\u2019s high-dollar purchase of a new refrigerator is likely to be more welcomed by his wife than a purchase of a firearm for the exact same price. Typical reactions are often some form of \u201cYou bought a<em>what</em>?!\u201d or, if this isn\u2019t the first time, \u201cYou bought an<em>other</em>one?!\u201d</p>",
            "<img alt=\"FInding The Right Credit Card Processor for Your Gun Shop\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dreamstime_s_29669994.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Chargeback Countermeasure Specialists</h2>",
            "<p>This susceptibility of firearms retailers to chargebacks means that you should pay particular attention to a credit card payment processor\u2019s ability to help you eliminate chargebacks where possible and minimize them in other circumstances. As has been mentioned,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\">a good payment gateway</a>, whether online or in person, can do much in this area.</p>",
            "<p>Customers want a smooth and secure transaction when making payments. Since legitimate (non-fraudulent) chargebacks are caused by some type of dissatisfaction or regret, the better the customer\u2019s experience interacting with you and your system, the less likely it will be for a chargeback to occur. A related aspect is the clarity of your return/refund policy and how effectively it is communicated. Customers sometimes initiate a chargeback because they have missed the deadline for returning the product for a refund. They are less likely to miss the deadline if they have a clear understanding of when it is and what the requirements are.</p>",
            "<p>Another measure that can help is to avoid pushing the customer to make the purchase<em>right here, right now</em>. Although some \u201cexperts\u201d teach that you have to close the deal when the customer is at maximum emotion, that practice is short-sighted and tends to cause businesses more headaches (and financial loss) than healthy growth. Allowing the customer to take just a bit more time to think about the purchase can be the difference between a costly chargeback and a repeat customer.</p>",
            "<p>Your high-risk payment processor should be an expert in effective ways to combat chargebacks. Mitigating chargebacks as much as possible will be beneficial not only to your business, but to the payment processor\u2019s business as well.</p>",
            "<h2>The Shifting Regulatory Jungle</h2>",
            "<p>The firearms industry is highly regulated in the United States, and the laws and regulations of individual states and municipalities are sometimes in conflict, with each other and with federal laws and regulations. On top of that, those laws and regulations<a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2022/07/bipartisan-safer-communities-act-gun-law/\">frequently change</a>. Your payment processor should be able to help you navigate that path.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also important that your credit card payment processor be flexible and able to adapt to the changing landscape of the firearms industry. The right credit card processor for your Gun Shop can then also help your business adapt.</p>",
            "<h2>Ask Questions, Then Ask More Questions</h2>",
            "<p>A high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>specializes in payment processing for high-risk industries and understands the payment processing needs and challenges of the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-firearms/\">firearms industry</a>.

            "<h1>Three Things You Need For A Firearms Merchant Account</h1>",
            "<p>Most aspects of starting a firearms retail business are the same as other retail businesses and are relatively easy. Generally speaking, you need the appropriate licenses and certifications, products to sell, and a way for your customers to see your products and make a selection. There is one more thing that all businesses need: a way to accept payments from customers. If you will be accepting payments by credit/debit card, that means getting a merchant account. Let\u2019s take a look at three things you need for a firearms merchant account.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Federal Firearms License</h2>",
            "<p>Before anything else\u2014and to operate your business legally in the first place\u2014you need a Federal Firearms License (FFL). FFLs are issued by the<a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/\">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives</a>(ATF) and are required to manufacture, import, or otherwise be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/file/100871/download\">engaged in the business of dealing in firearms</a>.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>The factors that are considered when determining whether you are \u201cengaged in the business\u201d include \u201cwhether you represent yourself as a dealer in firearms; whether you are repetitively buying and selling firearms; the circumstances under which you are selling firearms; and whether you are looking to make a profit.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Also keep in mind that there are<a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/types-federal-firearms-licenses-ffls\">multiple types of FFL</a>, including three for dealers, three for manufacturers, two for importers, and one for collectors. A variety of information and other resources are available on<a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/resource-center\">the ATF website</a>. Failure to fulfill legal requirements could have serious consequences, so ask as many questions as necessary to make sure that you are in strict compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.</p>",
            "<p>Even when operated in perfect legal compliance, firearms businesses are considered to be high risk, and it is unlikely that a traditional bank will provide you with a merchant account. If you are not doing business legally, no legitimate bank or other payment processor will even consider accepting your business as a client.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Note</strong>: In addition to federal laws and regulations, individual states may have their own gun laws. Be sure to understand and be in compliance with the laws and regulations of all states in which you will do business.</p>",
            "<h2>Looking at Your Options</h2>",
            "<p>There are generally two options for getting a merchant account. One is to go to a traditional bank. The other is to go to a payment processing firm. When it comes to firearms businesses, each of these options can be divided again, based on the organization\u2019s degree of willingness to do business with high-risk businesses. In other words, there are banks that are willing to provide services to firearms businesses and banks that are not. Similarly, there are payment processors that will take on such high-risk merchants as clients and processors that will not.</p>",
            "<p>You could try applying for services at banks, etc., that are reluctant to provide your business with services, but even if you are successful at opening an account, the conditions will be strict, and it won\u2019t take much to get<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/bank-account-for-high-risk-merchant-accounts/\">your account closed suddenly</a>. It\u2019s the kind of \u201csuccessful\u201d that doesn\u2019t feel too terribly successful.</p>",
            "<p>Your best option\u2014and possibly your only realistic option if you can\u2019t find a bank willing to give you an account\u2014is likely a high-risk payment processor.</p>",
            "<h2>High-risk Payment Processors</h2>",
            "<p>In general,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">high-risk payment processors</a>specialize in matters related to the processing of credit/debit card payments for businesses in industries that are considered to be high risk. The reasons that businesses are considered to be high risk tend to be a high chargeback rate and a high occurrence of fraud. Chargebacks and fraud risk are basics for high-risk payment processors, but individual firms may have their own specialties as well.</p>",
            "<p>One benefit of the knowledge and experience that brings is that a high-risk payment processor can help you reduce the risks that make your business high risk. Those risks have the potential to cost your business a lot of money. It\u2019s important to implement measures to eliminate risks when possible, and to minimize the negative consequences when not.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Three Things You Need for a Firearms Merchant Account\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FirearmsMerchantAccount.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Complex Legal Matters</h2>",
            "<p>Matters related to the sale, ownership, and possession of firearms can be contentious. Despite codification of the human right to possess firearms in the U.S. Constitution, there continue to be factions that work to enact legislation that<a href=\"https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/sep/12/gun-rights-backers-call-credit-card-plan-step-towa/\">severely curbs, or even prohibits</a>, the exercise of that right. Both sides of the issue and people all along the spectrum in between can get very emotional about it. The result is volumes of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. This is complicated by the unstable and often ambiguous nature of those laws and regulations.</p>",
            "<p>There also continue to be cases in which firearms manufacturers and dealers are blamed for the actions of individuals who have committed crimes using guns purchased from the manufacturer or dealer. In some cases, it is limited to pockets of public outcry, but at times it actually ends up as a matter of<a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/families-sandy-hook-victims-allowed-sue-ar-15-amanda-prestigiacomo\">civil or criminal court proceedings</a>. Whether holding a merchant accountable for the actions of a customer is reasonable/rational or not, the reality is that firearms merchants, as well as banks, etc., that provide those merchants with payment processing services, face the risk of negative public opinion and legal problems.</p>",
            "<h2>Eternal Vigilance</h2>",
            "<p>Once you have obtained the necessary licenses and certifications and found a high-risk payment processor that is familiar with the firearms industry, it is vital that your business continues implementing measures against risks. It is also important for you to monitor societal and legal changes related to firearms and revise your measures to handle those changes.</p>",
            "<p>The combination of common risks, such as chargebacks and fraud, and risks unique to the firearms industry, such as legal action related to the actions of customers, can require a lot of time, effort, and resources. Fortunately, a high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>can help you to alleviate that burden.</p>",

            "<h1>The Problematic Legal Standing of CBD</h1>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s talk about the problematic legal standing of CBD. Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the main components of cannabis, constituting as much as 40% of its extract. While it does not have the psychoactive properties of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\u2014the other main component of cannabis\u2014CBD does have a variety of uses related to human health. Research on new potential uses is ongoing and cannabis-related industries are growing.</p>",
            "<p>Of course, if you have started a CBD-related business or are planning to do so, you probably have a good idea of the problematic legal standing of CBD. Your business faces certain challenges and obstacles that most businesses do not. One of those challenges is finding a payment processor.</p>",
            "<p>Most traditional banks and popular payment processors are reluctant to work with any business that is particularly susceptible to risks that could cost a financial institution a lot of money. For a number of reasons, CBD-related businesses are considered to be \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">high-risk businesses</a>,\u201d which makes it difficult, and often impossible, to get a traditional bank to provide a merchant account. At the root of much of this is the current problematic legal standing of CBD from state to state.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Contradiction, Conflict, and Confusion of the Legal Standing of CBD</h2>",
            "<p>Laws and regulations related to CBD and other cannabis-related substances differ\u2014sometimes significantly\u2014between countries. Within the United States, there is inconsistency, contradiction, and conflict between the laws and regulations of local municipalities in the same state, between individual municipalities and the state, between the states themselves, and<a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/cbd-legal-states\">between states</a>and the federal government.</p>",
            "<p>That leads to quite a bit of confusion, and that confusion creates a higher risk that even a person or business with the best of intentions will get caught up in a legal entanglement. It is extremely important that you gain a clear understanding of the laws related to CBD in the area where your business is located, as well as where your customers are located.</p>",
            "<p>You will still need to monitor the situation since changes are frequent in many regions, but if you get a good handle on it prior to starting your business, or at least as early as possible if you have already started the business, that foundation will make it much easier to handle changes in the future.</p>",
            "<h2>Follow the Winding Road of Science For Legal Cannabis</h2>",
            "<p>One cause of the contradiction, conflict, and confusion in legal aspects is the scarcity of objective and reliable research and the lack of consensus in the medical and other scientific fields. It has become quite difficult to untangle research from political and ideological agendas, so the findings and conclusions tend to reflect the views and interests of the party that commissioned the study.</p>",
            "<p>The intention here is not to advocate a particular side in the debate, of course, but merely to point out that there are many underlying factors that affect the laws and regulations that your CBD business will have to follow. The issue of legal and illegal drug use, and even the issue of whether governments have a legitimate right to make decisions for the nation\u2019s people regarding drug use, are emotional issues for many people, further exacerbating the problem.</p>",
            "<h2>Legalization vs. Decriminalization</h2>",
            "<p>Further confusion is created by a lack of understanding that \u201clegalization\u201d and \u201ccriminalization\u201d are not the same thing. Generally speaking, the respective meanings are as follows.</p>",
            "<h3>The Problematic Legalization of CBD</h3>",
            "<p><strong><i>The act or process of changing the status of an action that is prohibited by law to no longer be prohibited by law</i></strong></p>",
            "<p>Legal acts are not subject to civil or criminal penalties or sanctions.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Example:</strong>If the possession and use of CBD are legal for any purpose that is not otherwise illegal, you won\u2019t get in trouble if the police catch you with it.</p>",
            "<h3>Decriminalization of CBD</h3>",
            "<p><strong><i>The act or process of removing criminal penalties from the legally stipulated punishments for committing an illegal act</i></strong></p>",
            "<p>An illegal act that is decriminalized is still illegal. The difference is that the punishment no longer includes a jail sentence. Instead, the individual is subject to a fine or other such civil penalty, and the violation does not become part of his or her criminal record.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Example:</strong>If the possession and use of CBD are illegal but decriminalized for any purpose that is not otherwise illegal, you\u2019ll get in trouble if the police catch you with it, but you won\u2019t go to jail.</p>",
            "<p>Many people have faced legal problems unnecessarily due to thinking that the decriminalization of a substance meant that they could use it any time they wanted to. Read the relevant legislation carefully, and consult with a qualified attorney if necessary. That time, effort, and expense will be worth it if it keeps you out of inadvertent trouble.</p>",
            "<h2>Long-term Vision and Patience of the Legal Standing of CBD</h2>",
            "<p>The list of legal industries and uses related to cannabis continues to grow, both through the legalization of previously illegal acts and through the discovery and development of new uses. In some cases, it\u2019s the rediscovery of old use. Negative public opinion, misconceptions about the nature of the various types of cannabis and its extract, and history of illegality and association with the crime world will likely continue to be challenges for CBD businesses to a certain extent in the short term, but the situation is changing.</p>",
            "<p>Although there is still plenty of propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation being pushed by the various parties involved, the general public is gradually becoming more educated on the issue, such as the crucial differences between the medically useful CBD and the psychoactive THC. These developments are still fairly recent, and many are ongoing.</p>",

If you have enough people on your customer service team, you could also divide the countries between multiple people.</p>",
            "<h3>Beware of inaccurate stereotypes and outdated information</h3>",

            "<p>You should probably avoid selling those products to customers in that country, to begin with, but at the very least you can inform the customer that there might be an issue. The worst-case scenario for your company is probably losing the ability to do business in that country. The customer, on the other hand, could end up paying fines or even going to jail.

Experienced specialists themselves can find it difficult to keep up with new developments, so it would be unreasonable to expect the general public to have more than a superficial understanding of the technology used in the products and services they use. The demand for technical support is unlikely to decrease much any time soon. It can be a lucrative, consistent market, with little impact from daily economic fluctuation. If that\u2019s the case, why is technical support business considered high risk?</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What is a High-risk Technical Support Business?</h2>",
            "<p>When we say \u201chigh-risk\u201d in this discussion, we\u2019re not necessarily talking about a store located in a high-crime neighborhood or an area prone to natural disasters. We\u2019re talking more specifically about<a href=\"https://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/report-view/business-in-conflict-affected-and-high-risk-contexts\">businesses</a>that traditional banks and other financial institutions, as well as typical payment processing firms, judge to pose a high risk of financial loss to the bank, etc.</p>",
            "<p>There are<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">two general categories</a>, or classifications, for high-risk businesses, namely \u201cRed Zone\u201d businesses and \u201cGrey Zone\u201d businesses. The \u201cRed Zone\u201d refers to businesses that are considered risky independently of their business history. Some of the factors that can put a business in the \u201cRed Zone\u201d are being in an industry that has a high risk of chargebacks, deals only with services or intangible products, deals in high-volume sales, fails frequently to comply with safety/security standards and regulations, or operates \u201cadult-oriented\u201d services (e.g., pornography, gambling, tobacco, weapons, alcohol).</p>",
            "<p>The \u201cGrey Zone\u201d refers to businesses that are considered risky because of their actual business history. Factors that can put a business in the \u201cGrey Zone\u201d include having a bad business credit score or none at all, having a high rate of chargeback regardless of the industry, being an international merchant, and accepting/dealing with foreign currency. Businesses that are in both the \u201cRed Zone\u201d and the \u201cGrey Zone\u201d are considered to pose the highest risk.</p>",
            "<p>Being a high-risk business does not necessarily mean that the business has less potential for success or that it\u2019s impossible for the business to be stable and secure. There are, however, certain challenges faced by high-risk businesses that are not faced by other businesses, at least not to the same degree. In addition, a significant factor in one industry or type of business may be a minor factor in others. Let\u2019s look at some of the main factors that make tech support business high risk.</p>",
            "<h3>Why is it a Problem to be a High-risk Business?</h3>",
            "<p>The first major drawback to being a high-risk business is that you may have difficulty getting a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\">merchant account at a traditional bank</a>. Banks are typically reluctant to provide merchant accounts and payment processing services to high-risk businesses. The factors that make a business high risk can result in significant loss to the business. In many cases that means loss to the bank as well. If the business fails, the bank could be left with an enormous financial obligation. It makes sense that banks would be cautious about taking on such risks.</p>",
            "<p>The second major drawback is that even if you are able to convince a bank to provide your business with a merchant account, the conditions to keep the account are likely to be strict. They may include a low chargeback threshold, higher fees, and no \u201csecond chances.\u201d Exceeding the bank\u2019s set chargeback limit could result in your account being terminated without warning, leaving you without a way to accept credit card payments.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"High Risk Tech Support Merchant Account with Zen Payments\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Tech-Support-Agent-1024x683.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Chargebacks for Technical Support</h2>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\">Chargebacks</a>are one of the most common factors that make a business high risk, regardless of the industry. Practically speaking, it\u2019s not possible to eliminate chargebacks completely if you regularly accept credit card payments. Banks understand that, of course. The problem is when the chargeback rate (the ratio of chargebacks compared to the number of transactions) is high. Because technical support usually involves services rather than a product, there is no way for the customer to return the purchase even if you provide a refund.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also more difficult to prove that a service lived up to the promises your business made than to prove that a product functions properly. In addition, tech support often involves ambiguity and the unknown. The customer is having a technological problem, and the cause may not be clear. There is often an element of trial and error. Sometimes there is a problem with hardware, but often the problem is with the user. Just about every person working in IT support has asked the question \u201cIs the cable connected?\u201d at least once.</p>",
            "<p>This ambiguity of expected and promised outcomes makes more room for a customer to be dissatisfied or to use dissatisfaction as a convenient excuse for demanding a refund. If the customer chooses to go directly to the bank instead of contacting the merchant to resolve the issue, the likely result will be a chargeback.</p>",
            "<h3>Fraud</h3>",
            "<p>Another factor is<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-1/\">fraud</a>. Chargebacks themselves can be fraudulent, or at least questionable. As mentioned above, when no tangible products are involved, it is difficult to dispute the customer\u2019s claim that the purchase was not as promised. There are also cases of \u201cfamily fraud\u201d and other types of \u201cfriendly fraud.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Tech support is often provided remotely, and there is little face-to-face interaction. Scammers thrive on anonymity, so it\u2019s not surprising that the tech support industry would be one of their targets. Countermeasures specific to electronic and remote transactions can be implemented, of course, but the fact remains that certain risks and vulnerabilities are more prevalent in such remote interaction than in direct, face-to-face transactions.</p>",
            "<p>As with computer viruses, malware, and other cyberthreats, there is an ongoing battle between scammers/hackers and the developers and implementers of countermeasures. Unfortunately, not every company has the expertise and resources to stay on top of this ever-changing situation. This is particularly true of new startups and smaller companies. Whether it\u2019s a \u201ccustomer\u201d using a stolen credit card number or a scammer using a hastily formed \u201ctech support business\u201d as a front, the potential from fraud comes from every angle.</p>",
            "<h2>Mitigating Tech Support Risks</h2>",
            "<p>In addition to conventional cybersecurity measures, there are a number of things that your business can do to mitigate risks and minimize the loss to your company. One is to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\">avoid the additional fees</a>and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">wasted time created by chargebacks</a>by providing the customer with a refund before the chargeback is completed. Businesses typically have 72 hours from the time a chargeback is initiated to provide the customer with a refund to prevent the chargeback. Businesses are ordinarily not notified of the initiation of a dispute, so it may be necessary to subscribe to a chargeback protection service or contact a payment processor for alerts when a dispute is filed.</p>",
            "<p>Another measure that can help reduce chargebacks is to divide charges for services into smaller units, such as charging for installation of software separately from the cost of the software itself. Customers are less likely to dispute a charge of ten or twenty dollars than a charge of one hundred or two hundred dollars. Be sure to give your customers a clear explanation so they know that charging in smaller units is not costing them more money. You may want to promote the flexibility of having smaller units and the resulting greater ability to customize services.</p>",
            "<h3>Reliable Payment Processing for Your Tech Support Business</h3>",
            "<p>Using a high-risk payment processor may be the only way for your business to get a merchant account. However, a capable high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>specializes in high-risk industries, and have the expertise, experience, and infrastructure to provide attentive, consistent service and smooth, reliable, and easy-to-understand payment processing. This means that your business may benefit greatly from using a high-risk payment processor, even if you don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to.</p>",
            "<p>The ideal is to find a payment processor that already services your industry, but either way, be sure to find a payment processor that has a wide range of technological tools (software, etc.), a solid commitment to thorough compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards, and a secure payment system and gateway. This can alleviate your customers\u2019 concerns about the security of financial transactions and may also help mitigate concerns about the security of the services themselves. Your payment process will be more efficient and problem-free, which makes it easier for your customers to make a purchase.</p>",
            "<p>A high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>specializes in payment processing for high-risk industries and understands the payment processing needs and challenges of the tech support industry. We have the experience and expertise necessary not only to get you a merchant account, but also to make the payment process easier for your customers and for you.</p>",

            "<p>If you\u2019ve been thinking about selling CBD, you\u2019re not alone. In the last four years, the market has really exploded. But what led to this sudden explosion?</p>",
            "<p>It all began back in 2018. This was when a<a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/agriculture-and-rural-development/state-industrial-hemp-statutes.aspx\">Farm Bill</a>was signed that legalized hemp. Before that, CBD was banned from sale by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>",
            "<p>After that, things moved pretty fast. With hemp legal, entrepreneurs rushed to set up successful CBD shops throughout the country. With the Farm Bill in place, everyone felt very confident about their ability to sell hemp.</p>",
            "<p>Soon, though, these vendors ran into a different challenge: most payment processors didn\u2019t want to help anyone sell hemp. To this day, it can be very difficult for a merchant to find a payment processor to help them accept payments for CBD products.</p>",
            "<h2>Why You Need a Merchant Account for CBD</h2>",
            "<p>You need a high-risk merchant account for CBD because CBD is considered a high-risk product. However, it is not considered high-risk for the usual reasons.</p>",
            "<p>Typically, businesses are labeled high-risk if they have a strong likelihood of chargebacks or fraud. This could include things like travel-related businesses where customers try to cancel trips at the last minute. It could also include things like subscription-based boxes (such as Loot Crate) where dissatisfied customers are likelier to charge a purchase back.</p>",
            "<p>CBD is a bit different. Typical CBD customers aren\u2019t much likelier to file chargebacks or engage in fraud than the average customer. Instead, CBD is considered high-risk because of its reputation.</p>",
            "<p>Despite the Farm Bill legalizing the sale of hemp, many people still associate it with marijuana. As such, most payment processors don\u2019t want to be associated with selling any product that the public thinks is connected to illegal drugs.

            "<p>For example, the FDA is always cracking down on<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-companies-illegally-selling-over-counter-cbd-products-pain-relief\">vendors selling CBD</a>. It\u2019s not that selling CBD is illegal. But some businesses, knowingly or unknowingly, end up selling products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These are the businesses that the FDA ends up cracking down on.</p>",

Potential employers, landlords, utilities companies, and insurance companies, for example, frequently use credit scores as part of the information considered when making decisions about hiring or providing services, etc. Simply being behind on payments can be fixed fairly easily. Pay the debt and the problem is gone. Being denied employment or housing because your credit history suggests that you pose an unacceptable risk can not only make it impossible for you to pay off your debt, but can also prevent normal daily living.</p>",
            "<h2>What is Credit Repair?</h2>",
            "<p>Credit repair businesses provide various services aimed at improving their clients\u2019 credit scores. These services range from general financial coaching to focused guidance on specific financial issues. Most of the time, people who go to a credit repair business want help to improve their credit scores or to consolidate their debt.</p>",
            "<p>Various factors impact your credit score. An important part of credit repair is to increase factors that increase your score and to decrease factors that decrease your score. Most of the negative factors are preventable, and a lot of the time it\u2019s not a complicated process to turn things around. If your income is high enough to cover your reasonable needs, all that you have to do is pay your bills on time. You can make a wise budget. You can avoid purchases that aren\u2019t really necessary.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, unforeseen and unpreventable things such as illness, injury, death, or other circumstances that are out of your control can be financially devastating. The inability to do things that help your credit is essentially the same as doing things that hurt your credit. The things that hurt your credit tend to affect each other, creating a negative cycle of ever-worsening credit. Credit repair services are intended to help people avoid or get out of that negative downward spiral.</p>",

In the case of a credit repair business, the customers are all people who currently have, or have had in the past, problems making payments. If your customers don\u2019t pay you, you can\u2019t pay the bank that processes payments, and in many cases, the bank ends up taking the financial hit.</p>",
            "<p>Another factor that can end up costing the bank a lot of money is fraud. Scammers prefer to target people who are desperate or otherwise vulnerable. A fake credit repair company can present itself as your savior from crushing financial woes, but then turn around and steal your identity. What seems like a small fee for that promised salvation could be part of how the scammer finances its illegal activities.</p>",

Even when identified, it may be difficult to take action against fraudulent chargebacks. If banks already have doubts about the trustworthiness of your customers, they will have doubts about the legitimacy of chargebacks initiated by those customers. Ultimately, the perception is that your business has a particularly high possibility of being victimized by a scammer even if your chargeback rate is only slightly elevated.</p>",

            "<p>Echecks are a form of payment that travels directly through accounts with existing money. Just like a real check, they draw customer payments from their checking account. Unlike credit card payments, this means the money is not loaned from a bank, it belongs to the customer. With this underlying difference, there are many benefits that arise in this type of transaction.</p>",
            "<h3>Benefits Of High Risk Echeck Payments</h3>",
            "<ul><li><b>Lower Processing Fees</b>\u2013 Credit card payments are managed through credit card companies like Visa, Master Card, and American Express. These companies have their own baseline fees associated with transactions. Even your merchant account provider has to pay these fees, and there is no way out of them. Luckily, when paying with an echeck you circumvent those companies and can save money on extra expenses.</li><li><b>Reduced Chargebacks</b>\u2013 Chargebacks are<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/rapid-dispute-resolution/\"><b>payment disputes</b></a>made through customer banking channels. They are executed through card payment channels so echecks are safe from them.</li><li><b>Faster Payments</b>\u2013 When you receive a real check, cash isn\u2019t delivered instantly. It usually takes around 48 hours for the check to travel from one location to another. Echecks take some time to process, but can be as fast as 24 hours.</li><li><b>Consistency</b>\u2013 Many companies set up echeck payments so they can make steady monthly withdrawals. Landlords and subscription companies alike prefer this direct route of check-like payments to ensure their funds are coming in steadily.</li></ul>",
            "<h2>How Do Echeck Payments Work?</h2>",
            "<p>Initially, a company needs to collect banking and routing information from a customer\u2019s bank account. On a paper check, these numbers are located at the bottom and are available to see to anyone receiving the physical item. Nowadays, these numbers can easily be viewed online through their<a href=\"https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/banking-app\"><b>banking application</b></a>.</p>",
            "<h2>What\u2019s The Difference Between an Echeck, EFT, ACH, and Wire Transfer?</h2>",
            "<ul><li><b>Echec</b>k \u2013 Works like a standard check by drawing money from a bank account using routing and account number.</li><li><b>EFT</b>\u2013 Stands for Electronic Funds Transaction. This term used to cover many types of electronic transfers including Echeck, credit card, and direct deposit.</li><li><b>ACH</b>\u2013 Stands for<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/ach-payment-processing/\">Automated Clearing House</a>. They are the entity that regulates bank-to-bank payments. The payment itself is different from an echeck because it uses batch processing to aggregate transactions.</li><li><b>Wire Transfer</b>\u2013 These typically charge a fee and are used for international transactions or large payments.</li></ul>",
            "<h3>What High Risk Industries Use Echeck?</h3>",

            "<h3>Subscription Businesses</h3>",
            "<p>A subscription payment model is not just for subscription boxes. Monthly payments are made for software, rent, fitness, and legal services. Anyone who bills on a monthly basis would see increased benefits from transferring their customers from credit cards to echeck.</p>",
            "<h3>Ecommerce Shops</h3>",
            "<p>Ecommerce makes up around 15% of all purchased transactions, and many people want different options to make these payments. Online stores should cater to the increasing market and offer payment options outside of credit cards. In Europe for example, over a quarter of payments are bank-to-bank so if you\u2019re selling to an international audience, be sure to have options that are familiar and trusted.</p>",

            "<h1>What is a Merchant Account Reserve?</h1>",
            "<p>If you have already tried to open a merchant account for a high-risk business at a traditional bank, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that you are more confused and have more questions now than before you consulted with your friendly neighborhood banker. If your application wasn\u2019t rejected outright, and you were told about the stricter requirements for high-risk businesses, one of those questions might be \u201cWhat is a merchant account reserve?\u201d</p>",
            "<p>That question was probably followed by \u201cDo I have to have one?\u201d If you made it all the way to thinking \u201cWhy do I have to have one?\u201d you might not be in the best mood right now.</p>",
            "<p>Well,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>is here to help, so let\u2019s see if we can make it a bit clearer.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>It\u2019s Probably Because of Chargebacks</h2>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re not sure why traditional banks aren\u2019t very welcoming to your high-risk business, or why the bank suddenly canceled your merchant account, you can assume that it has something to do with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">chargebacks</a>, and there\u2019s an excellent chance that you\u2019ll be right. There are, of course, a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">variety of reasons</a>that certain industries or types of business are considered to be high risk, but having a chargeback rate that is higher than the set maximum is one of the most common.</p>",
            "<p>Since chargebacks are something that every business that accepts credit card/debit card payments must deal with to one degree or another, it\u2019s not surprising that some businesses will have characteristics\u2014sometimes inherent to the industry\u2014that make them more susceptible to chargebacks. Banks and merchants both dislike chargebacks. In a nutshell, the reason is that chargebacks are a drain on money and time without adding any value.</p>",
            "<h3>A \u201cJust in Case\u201d Safety Net</h3>",
            "<p>Providing a merchant account and other merchant services to high-risk businesses places certain obligations on the bank. Ordinarily, when a customer initiates a chargeback, the bank provides the refund, and then is reimbursed by the merchant. There are also various penalties and other additional fees that the merchant is required to pay when there is a chargeback. If a business doesn\u2019t have enough money in its merchant account to cover the refund and fees, the bank is stuck with the loss. It can also cover things like loss due to fraud, failure of your business, etc.</p>",
            "<p>Many people are familiar with escrow accounts that are set up when a bank provides someone with a loan. A certain amount (usually a percentage) is placed in the escrow account in preparation for a situation in which the person that took out the loan is unable to make payments, or there are other factors related to the loan that result in a loss by the bank. The money in the escrow account belongs to the customer, but it can\u2019t be accessed by the customer until certain requirements are met, indicating that the bank\u2019s risk of loss decreased enough.</p>",
            "<p>A merchant account reserve is basically the same type of arrangement. In this case, however, the \u201cloan\u201d provided by the bank is the amount used to provide the refund, etc. As with a typical escrow account, the amount of the reserve is a percentage of the transaction. The percentage is usually around 10%, but it can be higher depending on the specific type of risk that is involved. The money in the account is still your money, but you can\u2019t access it until you have fulfilled certain requirements and the money is released.</p>",
            "<h2>Do I Have to Have a Merchant Account Reserve?</h2>",
            "<p>The answer to the question \u201cDo I have to have a merchant account reserve?\u201d ultimately depends on the bank.<a href=\"https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/merchant-reserve-account\">Different banks have different rules</a>, and the rules of a single bank may differ greatly depending on the industry. However, there are a number of things that can be good indicators of whether you will have to maintain a reserve.</p>",
            "<p>One such indicator is how high the risk is for your high-risk business. The exact definitions and thresholds, etc., vary, but there are three broad categories for assessing the level of risk.</p>",
            "<p>A business in this category is considered by banks to pose an unacceptably high level of risk. In most cases, applications from these merchants are rejected, so the need for a merchant account reserve doesn\u2019t even come up.</p>",
            "<p>A business in this category is considered by banks to pose an acceptable level of risk, so there is no significant need for the bank to establish extra protection against financial loss. In this case as well, the need for a merchant account reserve may not even come up.</p>",
            "<p>In some cases, a business or industry is considered to have, at the very least, a level of risk that requires consideration or caution, but not to the degree that it should be rejected outright. The bank may be willing to give your business a chance, but only if you are willing to make sure that there are funds to cover potential losses by the bank.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s where a merchant account reserve can be useful. You may have all the confidence in the world in your business, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the bank does. The compromise is that the bank gives you a chance and you ensure that any loss incurred by the bank will be minimal.</p>",
            "<h3>Types of Reserve</h3>",
            "<p>There are three basic types of merchant account reserve, as follows.</p>",
            "<p>This is usually what people mean when talking about merchant account reserves. A certain percentage (generally 5% to 15%) of each credit card transaction is withheld and put in the reserve account. It remains in the reserve until a set amount of time passes, and then it is released and available for the merchant to use.</p>",
            "<p>It is a straight percentage, so there is not necessarily a maximum amount that can be held in the reserve, just a maximum percentage that can be withheld from each transaction.</p>",
            "<p>At the end of the hold period, amounts that were put in the reserve at the start of the hold period will be released. It is then replaced by a percentage of recent transactions. That cycle continues, providing the \u201crolling\u201d part of \u201crolling reserve.\u201d Although the amount in the reserve may not change much, it is \u201cnew\u201d in the sense that it is associated with a new transaction.</p>",
            "<p>For the most part, a capped reserve is identical to a rolling reserve, with the only real difference being that a capped reserve also has a maximum amount. Money is withheld at the set percentage, but when the total balance reaches the set maximum, money is no longer withheld unless the balance drops below the maximum again.\ufffc</p>",
            "<p>An up-front reserve is similar to a security deposit that is paid when someone rents an apartment. The amount may be calculated according to a percentage, and there may be a maximum balance, but what differentiates an up-front reserve from rolling and capped reserves is that the total maximum amount must be paid (placed in the reserve account) at the beginning of the period of services provided by the bank.</p>",
            "<p>* It should be kept in mind that some banks, etc., offer (or require) an account that is, to a certain degree, unique to that financial institution. Be sure to ask as many questions as necessary to make sure that you understand what is available and what is required in your specific case.</p>",
            "<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>",
            "<p>To a certain extent, there\u2019s not much that a high-risk business can do to avoid being required to have a merchant account reserve. The good news is that<a href=\"https://www.globallegallawfirm.com/how-reserve-funds-work/\">it doesn\u2019t have to be permanent</a>. In many cases, 90 consecutive days of no chargebacks is enough to get the requirement lifted.</p>",
            "<p>Of course, opening a high-risk merchant account with a high-risk payment processor can take care of a lot of these problems. Because a high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>specializes in payment processing for high-risk industries, it knows those industries better than a traditional banker would, and could be exactly what you need, not only to get a merchant account, but also to get your high-risk business operating smoothly and effectively. From reducing chargebacks to preventing fraud to making sure that your customers always have an easy-to-use payment portal and a trouble-free experience, we can help you navigate the sometimes confusing path of a high-risk business.</p>",

            "<p>MLM merchant processing is risky if you do not have the right payment processing solution. Financial institutions view MLM businesses as more challenging clients for a few reasons.</p>",
            "<p>One reason is that their legal procedures are blurry. The second is that their growth is quite unpredictable. Last, they could incur a high rate of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/rapid-dispute-resolution/\">chargebacks</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Here is a deeper dive into these three variables.</p>",
            "<h2>Legal Procedures Are Blurry</h2>",
            "<p>Unfortunately, it can be difficult for a financial institution to distinguish between a business that is legitimate and one that is an \u201cillegal\u201d pyramid scheme. The illegal pyramid schemes give the entire industry a poor reputation. So, many businesses, like financial institutions, will choose to avoid working with a company that sells in this model.</p>",
            "<p>This means that as an MLM merchant, you must seek a partner that specializes in MLM merchant processing, as they often will have a relationship with a financial institution that will give you the support you deserve.</p>",
            "<p>Before they approve your MLM merchant account, they will know what they need to look for and what to request from you to ensure you have success together.</p>",
            "<h2>Uncertain Growth</h2>",
            "<p>To make money, MLM businesses rely on their distributors\u2019 sales efforts, which is why it is difficult to predict their finances for the future. It could seem nearly impossible.</p>",
            "<p>This is another reason that a financial institution or credit card processing company can view MLMs as a substantial risk in terms of a customer. In their eyes, how could you manage a company efficiently when you are unsure what your revenue will be next month?</p>",
            "<p>Further, most people who work for MLM businesses are independent contractors. This is not a \u201clegitimate\u201d full-time or part-time employee.<a href=\"https://www.northwesternmutual.com/life-and-money/1099-vs-w-2-employee/\" target=\"_blank\">Independent contractors have an incentive</a>to work for the company if they wish, but they are not under any specific obligation.</p>",
            "<h3>High Rate of Chargebacks</h3>",
            "<p>Again, MLM businesses follow a different kind of model. This model is prone to a high number of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">chargebacks</a>.</p>",
            "<p>What is a chargeback? This happens when a customer does not come to you for a refund. Instead, they choose to circumvent the process, avoiding settling the matter with the MLM merchant and going straight to their bank for a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-strict-refund-policies-can-hurt-you/\">refund</a>.</p>",
            "<p>When chargebacks occur, the MLM merchant does not have an opportunity to make the customer whole or offer a refund. Rather, they are in a position where they must accept consequences from the customer\u2019s bank, as the institution imposes it on their MLM merchant account.</p>",
            "<p>If you think about it, that makes everything up for grabs. Anything your sales team will sell could encounter a chargeback. Some cases can be fraud, and other cases can be an error internally.</p>",
            "<p>No matter the reason that it happens, it puts your company in jeopardy. However, there are ways you can prevent chargebacks.</p>",
            "<h3>Preventing Chargebacks</h3>",
            "<p>If you are a new MLM merchant, each chargeback is important. You do not want a high chargeback ratio, because you may incur an excessive number of financial penalties.</p>",
            "<p>Also, too many chargebacks could mean the processing vendor is justified to end your MLM merchant account. When you have an account termination, it makes it more challenging in the future to open a new account.</p>",

            "<p>Lower payment processing rates are decided by the merchant account provider you choose. Each custom payment processor is different and has separate pricing models depending on your type of account. Mainstream providers tend to lock in steady pricing to compete with one another, but if you want lower rates you\u2019ll have to meet certain qualifications.</p>",

            "<h2>Negotiating Lower Processing Rates</h2>",
            "<p>Firstly, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that every payment processor is a business. As such, they want to avoid risk and maximize their revenue streams. Utilize this premise as a negotiating tool to have them focus more attention on your file and offer decreased rates</p>",
            "<ol><li><b>Leverage Your Size</b>\u2013 Also called<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-volume-merchant-account/\"><b>monthly volume</b></a>in the processing world is your revenue stream that\u2019s generated through steady customer transactions. This dictates the importance of your account as a customer to the payment processing company. For example, if you\u2019re processing over $50K per month through your merchant account, you\u2019re likely paying too much for processing fees. Businesses this size can negotiate with a new payment processor like Zen Payments to review your current payment structure and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\"><b>decrease your fees</b></a>.</li><li><b>Establish History</b>\u2013 As your business continues to grow over your time your transaction history becomes more stable. This is good news for the bank that hosts your merchant account. The more likely they can count on your business to provide steady payments, the more room you have to request lower rates. Conversely, startups may pay a premium on their<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merchant-account.asp#:~:text=These%20fees%20can%20range%20from,as%20any%20special%20situation%20fees.\"><b>merchant account fees</b></a>.

Not to worry, after you\u2019ve proven your business model is sound and steady income is flowing your risk profile decreases.</li><li><b>Find Custom Payment Processing</b>\u2013 Standard payment processing providers include PayPal, Square, and Stripe. These three are considered aggregate payment processors because they bundle merchant accounts together and have low risk profiles. Moreover, they approve accounts quickly which means they drop certain businesses after reviewing the contents of their site. They\u2019re prices are locked in at around 2.9% of the total purchase and $0.30 per transaction.</li><li><b>Ask To Negotiate</b>\u2013 Many business owners often forget that in order to get lower fees, you have to ask. Like anything, the rates you pay are decided by the business your working with and can be lowered if you make sure they have skin in the game. Underwriters, sales people, and executives alike all have skin in the game and want to open your account. Be sure to ask for lower rates in order to establish a groundwork that your goal is to save money. If your business is fully qualified with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\"><b>high volume</b></a>, a long transaction history, and isn\u2019t in a high risk vertical, then you\u2019ll likely get an offer from your merchant provider for lower fees.</li></ol>",
            "<p><b>Compare Businesses</b>\u2013 There are numerous merchant account providers out there, and each of them looks at fees through their own lens. Some offer quick approvals at basic rates while others work with merchants to evaluate their specific business and provide the best rates possible when it comes to transaction costs.</p>",

            "<p>Federal Crackdowns on the Coaching Industry has become a hot topic, staying compliant the coaching industry has become a challenge for many businesses. Businesses in high-risk industries are often particularly susceptible to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-2/\">fraud</a>, they tend to get special scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). One such industry that the FTC has been giving much attention in recent years is the online coaching industry. The issues that have drawn the attention of the FTC are also issues that have contributed to online coaching businesses being labeled<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/whats-considered-a-high-risk-merchant/\">high risk</a>. This comes down to the high risk of scams, false advertising, and significant financial harm.</p>",
            "<p>The International Coaching Federation (ICF), the \u201cmain credentialing body for the global coaching community,\u201d predicts that the coaching industry will continue to see significant growth, particularly in niche<a href=\"https://coachingfederation.org/blog/3-trends-that-will-shape-the-future-of-coaching\">sectors</a>.</p>",
            "<p>That growth has increased those risks, and will likely continue to do so in the future. The coaching industry has escaped regulation to a great degree, but is currently becoming more regulated. That is also likely to continue.</p>",
            "<p>While this increased scrutiny may help eliminate dishonest and predatory coaching businesses, it can end up being an unnecessary drain on time and money for legitimate coaching businesses. So, what can you do to keep the FTC off your back so you can focus all of your resources on building and improving your business?</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Licensing and Certification</h2>",
            "<p>One complicating factor in this is the inconsistency of requirements between individual states and between states and the federal government. Some states require that business coaches, personal life coaches, and other types of coach obtain licensing and certification, but some states do not. In some cases, there may be reciprocity between states, but in some cases there may not. The amount of impact that has on your business mainly depends on whether or not you provide your services outside your state.</p>",
            "<p>Whether it is required or not in the locations you do business, officially registering your business and obtaining the relevant licensing and certification are the first steps in demonstrating to the FTC, etc., that your business is legitimate. The FTC may investigate perfectly legitimate businesses because they don\u2019t \u201clook\u201d legitimate. Accurate or not, the absence of business registration, licensing, and certification is a red flag to the FTC.</p>",
            "<p>Registering trademarks, copyrights, domains, your business name, and other intellectual property also can go a long way toward demonstrating that everything is in order and compliant in your business.</p>",
            "<h3>Promises and Transparency</h3>",
            "<p>In any business, it is very important to be careful about the promises that you make regarding your products and services. If a company sells toasters, let\u2019s say, promising that plugging it in, putting bread in the slots, and pressing the designated lever or button will result in a piece of toast poses very little risk of an accusation of false advertising (assuming that your product is not defective). In almost every case, toaster manufacturers can control whether the toaster toasts bread or not.</p>",
            "<p>In the case of something like coaching, however, the outcomes are determined to a great degree by factors that are not under your control. Coaching outcomes can also be difficult to measure, so the degree to which they live up to your promises can be a matter of interpretation or debate. Extreme and outrageous promises are out, of course, but even reasonable promises may be difficult to prove.</p>",
            "<p>The promises you make on your website, in your marketing materials, or through direct conversation will be one of the first targets of FTC scrutiny, so you need to keep your enthusiasm in check and be very, very careful about your claims.</p>",
            "<p>Transparency and thorough, appropriate disclosure of relevant information about you, your staff, and your business are an important part of avoiding accusations of false advertising. The lack of such transparency is another red flag to the FTC. Be strictly honest and upfront about what you actually can do and what you cannot do. In addition to keeping the FTC away, it will help keep requests for refunds and chargebacks to a minimum.</p>",
            "<h2>Documentation</h2>",
            "<p>Related to transparency and disclosure is documentation. Don\u2019t promise anything that you can\u2019t deliver, but document everything that you do promise. Require a contract to provide customers with your services. Be sure to include things like your refund policy, details of the services to be provided, what outcomes are and are not promised, deadlines and schedules, etc. If you don\u2019t have an attorney draw up the contract, at least have it reviewed by an attorney for both thoroughness and legality.</p>",
            "<p>This applies to your website as well. Your basic terms and conditions should be easy to access, as should your privacy policy. As the saying goes, \u201cThe Internet is forever.\u201d Be careful about what you post. In some cases, it may be wise to post an official retraction of a claim that you realize went a bit too far. You may have deleted the claim, but if somebody is determined to find it, he or she will find it, so you should have evidence that you rectified the problem in a timely manner.</p>",
            "<h3>Payment Processing and Accounting</h3>",
            "<p>The final area that can impact the FTC\u2019s perception of your business and either trigger or prevent an investigation is payment processing and accounting. Inconsistent payment processing and murky accounting are good ways to attract the attention of other federal and state agencies in addition to the FTC. If you lack the expertise to conducting accounting that is compliant with the relevant laws, regulations, and standards, it will be worth the time, effort, and money to hire or contract someone who does.</p>",
            "<p>Meanwhile, not having any problems with the FTC or compliance with laws and regulations will help you acquire a merchant account. Your online coaching business is a high-risk business, so banks and payment processors will review your request for an account with a strict eye. Ultimately, utilizing a high-risk payment processor is probably the best route to take. Their expertise and systems will be an important part of achieving and maintaining the level of compliance that will keep the FTC off your business\u2019 back.</p>"

            "<p>A cardholder will ask their bank to reverse a charge they made on their credit card and that posted to their account. Whereas a refund is money directly returned from a merchant, the bank issuer is the one who handles the chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>Customers request chargebacks for many reasons. Some common reasons include:</p>",
            "<p>Merchants should take preventative measures to stop some of these issues as standard good business practices. Regardless, these issues can still occur when you are a merchant.</p>",
            "<p>It is technically possible to reverse a chargeback, but it is extremely difficult. Unfortunately, the odds are usually not in favor of the merchant.</p>",
            "<h2>RDR for Chargebacks</h2>",
            "<p>As a merchant, you may not like the idea of triggering an automatic refund. However, remember the true cost of a chargeback. Between fees and overhead, it can be twice the amount of the original transaction.</p>",
            "<p>Not only that, if you fight the chargeback and win through a representative, it costs you. Plus, winning the dispute is never a guarantee.</p>",
            "<p>Each time you get a chargeback, it will raise your chargeback rate, resulting in significant negative consequences. Your payment processor may even drop you.</p>",
            "<p>Using Rapid Dispute Resolution to resolve chargebacks helps merchants tremendously. In fact, a dispute cannot turn into a chargeback because the refund is an automatic transaction.</p>",

            "<h3>How Does Rapid Dispute Resolution Work?</h3>",
            "<p>By default, the response to an RDR takes liability on behalf of the merchant for the dispute. It will then refund the cardholder. The rules set a definition of what disputes you will allow to be a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>You can fight them, though, and recover money. If a merchant allows all Rapid Dispute Resolutions to refund, then their chargeback rate will be impressively low. But<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">friendly fraudsters</a>can make a big financial impact too, and a negative one at that.</p>",
            "<p>Enrolling in RDR means each bank will route a dispute differently. They may not trigger a chargeback immediately. Instead, they will handle them in one of two ways.</p>",
            "<p>If it triggers a dispute with a card that is not a Visa, the dispute goes on pause for up to 72 hours. This gives the merchant time to respond.</p>",
            "<p>The merchant receives an alert. The merchant can accept the chargeback, or they can start a refund so that they can end the dispute.</p>",
            "<p>When the RDR gets a dispute regarding a Visa transaction, then it consults the rule set instead. This can include multiple elements of data from the transaction to set up definitions for their automatic refund rules.</p>",
            "<p>The rule set given by the merchant can include details regarding:</p>",
            "<p>If it \u201caccepts,\u201d the issuer receives an immediate credit. If there is a \u201cdecline,\u201d the dispute will move forward to the chargeback phase.</p>",
            "<p>If they find a dispute to be \u201cunqualified,\u201d it routes back to the merchant using Verifi CDRN. The merchant must refund the purchase in the merchant\u2019s<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/woocommerce-high-risk-payment-gateway/\" target=\"_blank\">payment gateway</a>or manually. Another option is that the merchant could allow the alert chargeback but use a representative to fight the chargeback.</p>",

            "<p>Now that you know more about how it works, you can see why Rapid Dispute Resolution offers significant benefits to merchants, issuing banks, and customers alike.</p>",
            "<p>When a customer receives immediate credit, they are happy. The issuing bank is happy that their customer is happy.</p>",
            "<p>They resolved the dispute before an alert even goes out. The acquiring bank is happy, too, because their merchant account is compliant.</p>",
            "<p>They eliminate duplicate alerts and chargebacks.</p>",

            "<h1>Virtual Terminal Payment Gateway</h1>",
            "<p>A virtual terminal payment gateway is an online tool that allows you to accept payments through your website. It\u2019s like a credit card reader for an ecommerce store. The virtual terminal collects credit card information and shares it with your merchant account to complete a transaction.</p>",
            "<p>Every company that sells products online needs a payment gateway to accept various types of payments. These payments can include credit cards, debit cards, google pay, ach payments or even cryptocurrency.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>How Does a Virtual Terminal Work?</h2>",
            "<p>A virtual terminal integrates with your online store as when you install it on your website. Shopping cart platforms like<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/shopify-high-risk-payment-processing/\">Shopify</a>or<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/woocommerce-high-risk-payment-gateway/\">WooCommerce</a>list the integrations that are most used with their<a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=1023&amp;collections=product&amp;page=1\">site</a>. Alternatively, some payment processors have their own custom code that they build with the payment gateway they\u2019ve created.</p>",
            "<p>At the point of transaction, a virtual terminal securely sends payment information to the parties involved. As a merchant your bank will receive this information and validate in less than a second. Once the transaction is approved, the confirmation appears on your customer\u2019s screen as a checkout confirmation.</p>",
            "<h3>Payment Gateway Fees</h3>",
            "<p>Unlike in-person terminals, an online payment gateway is free to install. You can easily access them through your payment processor. Besides the free integration, there may be a fee associated with each transaction. These fees are charges that occur every time someone makes a purchase. Oftentimes they\u2019re bundled in with your overall payment processing fees which run from 2% \u2013 5% of the purchase plus $0.10 per transaction.</p>",
            "<p>The payment gateway fee you pay depends on your industry type. High risk industries pay a premium for their payment processing because banks take on added risk with their accounts. These types of industries include adult, CBD, firearms, and more. You find if your company is in one of these categories by looking at a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\"><strong>high-risk industry list</strong></a>.</p>",

            "<p>The best virtual terminal will have multiple key features that benefit both you and your customers. Be sure to find one that fits your business needs and helps increase shopping conversions and the overall customer experience. Moreover, as a merchant you\u2019ll want one that helps organize your payment information, view past transactions, and creates reports.</p>",

            "<h1>What is a Certificate of Analysis?</h1>",
            "<p>As with many other plant-based/plant-derived substances, cannabidiol (CBD) must fulfill certain requirements before it can be sold or shipped legally. One of the most important is a certificate of analysis (COA). If you are thinking about starting a CBD-related business, you may have heard of it, but what is a certificate of analysis? Why is it required? How do you get one?</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>The Legal Status of CBD</h2>",
            "<p>The 2018 Farm Bill reclassified hemp and removed it from the Controlled Substance Schedules used by the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency. However,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/the-problematic-legal-standing-of-cbd/\">despite no longer being illegal</a>, hemp and hemp-derived CBD are still regulated, so there are requirements that you need to fulfill when selling or shipping it.</p>",
            "<p>Generally speaking, your business must have licenses to grow, process, or sell CBD products, the THC content of your products must be 0.3% or less, your growers and suppliers must be operating legitimate, correctly licensed businesses, and your business must have documents that show the results of testing to verify the content (including, most importantly in this case, the amount of THC).</p>",
            "<h3>What Information Does a COA Give You?</h3>",
            "<p>A certificate of analysis (COA) is a detailed report on the chemical analysis of a substance. Basically, a COA tells your customers what is in the CBD product, and how much of it is in the product. It\u2019s kind of like a nutritional fact chart on the back of a can of soup.</p>",
            "<p>The certificate usually includes supplier information, materials identification, transportation data, signature data, and evidence of conformance. The last of these is the most important part of the certificate. It includes the properties of the substance, test-based evidence, and information on how the analyzed substance is in compliance with the relevant requirements and standards.</p>",
            "<p>A COA also tells customers whether or not the product contains toxic or otherwise dangerous substances, such as pesticides. Even aside from legal requirements, a COA can be an important part of keeping your customers safe.</p>",
            "<p>Certificates of analysis must be obtained from an<a href=\"https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/hemp/dea-laboratories\">accredited third-party laboratory</a>. In most cases, the laboratory tests individual runs of a CBD product, and a COA is issued for each run individually.</p>",
            "<p>An overview of FDA guidelines for the certificate itself can be found<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-q7a-good-manufacturing-practice-guidance-active-pharmaceutical-ingredients#P960_68414\">here</a>.</p>",
            "<h2>Why Do I Need a Certificate of Analysis?</h2>",
            "<p>One reason that you need a COA is, of course, to make sure that you are not operating your business illegally, and that you have evidence of that fact. There are, however, other reasons that you might need to have a COA, or at least would be wise to have it.</p>",
            "<p>Because of restrictions on cannabis and hemp products, one issue your CBD business will likely face is shipping your products. A COA can do much to solve that issue. For example,<a href=\"https://www.usps.com/ship/shipping-restrictions.htm#hemp-cbd\">the U.S. Postal Service can carry CBD products</a>, but the merchant must submit certain documents and certifications. One of these is a COA.</p>",
            "<p>Another example is the fact that many states require cannabis and CBD product labels to include a custom QR code that is linked to the COA. Be sure to check<a href=\"https://www.sttark.com/blog/what-is-a-cbd-certificate-of-analysis-and-how-to-read-one\">state and municipal laws/regulations</a>for the state where your business is located as well as states that are the destination of your products, and make sure that your labels are compliant.</p>",
            "<h3>Getting Help with The Process</h3>",
            "<p>Traditional banks and other financial institutions usually consider the CBD industry to be high risk. At best, they are hesitant about opening a merchant account for CBD businesses. More often than not, they won\u2019t consider it at all. The best option is likely to be using the services of a high-risk payment processor.</p>",
            "<p>What are the benefits of using a high-risk payment processor for your CBD business? First, a high-risk payment processor may be the only processor that is willing to open a merchant account for your business. Second, a high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-cbd-merchant-account/\">Zen Payments</a>specializes in payment processing for high-risk industries, so it knows those industries better than a traditional banker would.</p>",
            "<p>That expert knowledge and experience can be a great resource for your business, and can make it easier for you to navigate the process of getting COAs and being in compliance with related laws and regulations.</p>",
            "<p>When choosing a high-risk payment processor, be sure to ask as many questions as necessary until you\u2019re satisfied with the responses and clear on what you can expect and what will be expected of you.

Online firearm retailers have reported increases in sales during the pandemic, and you need your business to keep up with the demand of gunbroker pay.</p>",
            "<p>Navigating gunbroker pay platforms can be challenging, especially when using popular sites like Gunbroker. Yet, if you want to set up a platform where you can learn how to receive gunbroker payments and legitimize your company, you need a reliable credit card processing platform and service.</p>",
            "<p>With high-risk businesses, you can face frozen assets and be dropped as a client. These hindrances can make it more challenging to develop business relations with other merchants and ensure safe transactions.</p>",
            "<p>In our complete guide, we will go over popular sites like Gunbroker and how you can find platforms to support your firearms sales. We will also address licensure laws and high-risk payment processing limitations.</p>",

            "<h2>What Is Gunbroker?</h2>",
            "<p>As a gunbroker, you have likely heard of the platform nicknamed after the term: Gunbroker. It is the largest online<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/ammo-inc-announces-delivery-donated-120000265.html\">auction-based marketplace</a>for selling firearms and hunting or shooting accessories. It functions similarly to other marketplaces, such as eBay.</p>",
            "<p>Ultimately, Gunbroker and its platform don\u2019t sell firearms directly. They help broker purchases, which could increase the risk of fraudulent business.</p>",
            "<p>The process of getting a gun isn\u2019t as simple as other consumer purchases. First, you will need to figure out payments for firearms. Next, you will need to familiarize yourself with a Federal Firearms License.</p>",
            "<p>In some circumstances, you can sell firearms without a license, but the buyer will usually need one. If not, you will have to send it to the nearest Federal Firearms License. However, there are several other platforms or e-commerce methods you can use to promote your firearms business.</p>",
            "<p>The primary challenge comes in a payment platform for gunbrokers and how to secure purchases and sales.</p>",
            "<h3>Gunbroker Pay Platforms</h3>",
            "<p>Gunbroker pay platforms are more complex than simply using your credit card or online payment platforms. Some platforms only offer high fees and limit scalability.</p>",
            "<p>As a gunbroker, you may run your own business, perform sales online, or both! If you operate an e-commerce platform, you need secure payment processing solutions and full chargeback protection.</p>",
            "<p>You need a platform that caters to your unique needs and protects against high-risk sales or purchases without dropping you as a client or freezing your assets.</p>",
            "<h2>Why Are Firearm Sales High Risk?</h2>",
            "<p>Increased federal regulation and attention make being a firearms seller extremely high risk. This means you could face having your assets frozen or encounter blocked online selling and purchases.</p>",
            "<p>Most industry providers will decline to set up accounts with high-risk merchants regarding firearm sales. This could lead to terminated accounts and leave you high and dry. When you start selling products or using platforms like Gunbroker, you need a company with experience in high-risk payment processing.</p>",
            "<p>A<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-firearms/\">merchant account provider</a>is a gateway between you making or losing money, and platforms like Gunbroker require payment gateways before getting started. Many popular wallets and platforms like PayPal will not undertake high-risk sales and purchases.</p>",
            "<h3>What Is a Federal Firearms License?</h3>",
            "<p>Federal Firearms License (FFL) laws are the second criteria regarding gunbroker pay and platforms. Gun laws are largely regulated at the state level, making it a bit challenging to narrow down definitively. However, there are a few federal firearm laws in place, but they are fairly loose regarding the application at the state level.</p>",
            "<p>There are two primary ways to carry a gun: concealed and open. States determine whether permits are needed to carry in public spaces. Applications can be exhaustive and time-consuming.</p>",
            "<p>An<a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/firearms/apply-license\">FFL is a license</a>different from a permit and allows you or your business to sell, manufacture, or import firearms.

            "<p>Once your business and operations are validated and in compliance with state and federal laws, you will issue a license. At this point, you can start operating your firearms sales.</p>",
            "<h4>Do You Need an FFL?</h4>",
            "<p>This answer is a bit convoluted since licensure is not necessary if you simply collect guns. However, as a firearms dealer, you need an active FFL, especially if you trade multiple firearms.</p>",
            "<p>Dealers are also individuals who trade or sell firearms at wholesale or retail. You will also need a license if you specialize in certain trigger mechanisms or stocks. Lastly, pawnbrokers are also certified dealers and must undergo FFL requirements.</p>",

            "<h1>How to Reduce Your Chargeback Rate</h1>",
            "<p>Each month, your bank or payment processor adds up all the chargebacks initiated toward your business\u2019 account that month and divides it by the total of all transactions. The resulting percentage is called the \u201cchargeback rate.\u201d Banks set a certain level of chargebacks that it views as acceptable, typically about 3% or less. If your business\u2019 chargeback rate exceeds that amount, your merchant account may be suspended temporarily or canceled outright. That could result is significant loss in time and money, so it\u2019s important to think about how to reduce your chargeback rate.</p>",
            "<p>Chargeback rate is one of the main factors that banks, etc., use to determine whether a business is<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-2\">high risk or not</a>. That means that if your business is in a high-risk industry, you will be on an even shorter leash if a bank even opens a merchant account for you at all. The threshold for acceptable chargeback rates will be even lower than the already low 3% mentioned above.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Clear and Easily Understood Policies</h2>",
            "<p>It\u2019s always better to prevent chargebacks than to deal with them after they occur, and the best time to do that is before a purchase is finalized. One way to do that is to have a refund and return policy that is clear and easy to understand, and to bring it to the customer\u2019s attention early in the process, or even multiple times prior to finalizing the purchase. The customer may ultimately decide not to make the purchase, but it should decrease the risk of chargebacks and save you both time and money in the long run.</p>",
            "<h3>Tools to Reduce Chargebacks</h3>",
            "<p>There are a number of other measures and policies that you can<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\">implement as part of your daily operations</a>. In addition, there are various tools available to help you reduce your chargeback rate. Two of them are 3-D Secure and Rapid Dispute Resolution. Let\u2019s take a brief look at them.</p>",
            "<h2>3-D Secure</h2>",
            "<p>One tool that can be very useful in combating chargebacks is 3-D Secure. 3-D Secure (3DS) is a protocol that adds a layer of security for online credit card/debit card transactions. It utilizes the following three domains (the \u201c3-D\u201d in \u201c3-D Secure\u201d).</p>",
            "<p>The payment information and the identity of the customer (the cardholder) must be verified before the transaction can be completed.</p>",
            "<p>Because 3DS is aimed at battling fraud, it does not necessarily make a transaction \u201cchargeback-proof.\u201d There are a variety of reasons\u2014both legitimate and illegitimate\u2014for initiating a chargeback that are not related to fraud. However, chargeback fraud (including<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/friendly-fraud/\">\u201cfriendly\u201d fraud</a>, etc.) is a serious problem that can be very damaging to a business. With 3DS, if a customer claims that a purchase was fraudulent but there is a record that 3DS was used to verify the customer\u2019s identity, your business is protected.</p>",
            "<h3>Rapid Dispute Resolution</h3>",
            "<p>To help answer the question of how to reduce your chargeback rate we need to get into some new tools which are available for you to use. In April 2021, Visa partnered with Verifi to launch<a href=\"https://www.verifi.com/solutions-issuers/resolve-disputes/\">Rapid Dispute Resolution</a>(RDR), an upgrade of Visa\u2019s original Chargeback Dispute Resolution Network. In October 2021, Visa made it mandatory for card issuers to offer the service.</p>",
            "<p>The purpose of RDR is to automate dispute resolutions at the pre-dispute stage of a chargeback, making it possible to resolve disputes, avoid the dispute process, and prevent chargebacks. When a customer contacts the card issuer to request a chargeback, the information is entered into Visa\u2019s dispute submission platform. The system then determines whether or not to authorize a refund based on rules that are predefined by the seller.</p>",
            "<p>If it is authorized, your acquirer is notified through Visa\u2019s network, and a credit is provided to the customer on behalf of the issuer. Not only does this prevent a chargeback, but since the process is automated, little extra time is required to handle the issue. Together, these factors can help significantly to minimize the loss of time and money that ordinarily results from a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>Cases that do not meet the seller\u2019s pre-defined rules are handled in the standard chargeback process. Like 3DS, RDR is not a cure-all for chargebacks, but it can be a great tool for reducing and controlling the risk of chargebacks as well as the damage that results when chargebacks do occur.</p>",
            "<h3>Controlling Chargebacks with a High-risk Payment Processor</h3>",
            "<p>Good high-risk payment processors have the knowledge and experience to minimize the impact that chargebacks have on your business. Most also offer a variety of chargeback protection programs that can add another layer of security. They can also help you navigate the various tools available to combat chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>High-risk payment processors operate with the knowledge that your business is likely to have a higher chargeback rate than in other industries. They can set a reasonable and realistic threshold for allowable chargeback rates that takes that fact into consideration. As a result, you can have a bit more peace of mind without being in panic mode over the smallest increase in your chargeback rate.</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to ask questions and discuss any concerns, whether you\u2019re currently looking for a high-risk payment processor or you already have one. While it is true that they specialize in these issues, there are limitations to what they can do, even in the best of circumstances. Measures against chargebacks are most effective when you and your payment processor work as partners. Don\u2019t forget to use that valuable resource.</p>",

            "<h2>What Is 3D Secure?</h2>",
            "<p>3DS is a security technology that works kind of like a PIN code does for any online purchases. Businesses use 3DS to authenticate purchases for authorized cardholders. This layer of security helps protect merchants and cardholders from any bad transactions.</p>",
            "<p>This is a customer authentication protocol that was created<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-ecommerce/\">specifically for eCommerce</a>. The system validates buyers at the checkout, and many card networks recommend that merchants start using this.</p>",
            "<p>Each card brand has its own version of 3DS programs. If you don\u2019t want to set one up yourself, you can have someone else set it up for you. There are many third-party providers that can help you implement this security into your management plan.</p>",
            "<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>",
            "<p>This is a secure system that operates on a 3D model. This provides secure authentication between an online authorization process and the financial authorization process.</p>",
            "<p>The first domain in this system is the Acquirer Domain. This helps the bank and the merchant who receives the transaction payment. The second domain is the Issuer Domain.</p>",
            "<p>This is the bank that issued the credit or debit card used for the transaction. The third domain is the Interoperability Domain. This is in the infrastructure provided for the card. This third domain is what supports the secure protocol.</p>",
            "<p>The 3DS uses SSL communications and XML messaging. Both of these have authentication and secure transactions, and you can use them in many different ways.</p>",
            "<p>So when a customer checks out online, they\u2019ll have to enter their SecureCode that is provided by their card issuer. When they enter the code, the customer will be directed to the issuer\u2019s website in order to authorize the payment.</p>",
            "<p>Depending on which solution you want, sometimes the authorization can be completed in the payment solution without needing to go to another site.</p>",
            "<p>However, keep in mind that 3DS may not be supported for American Express, Discover Card, or any gift cards. The merchant can require what cards need to enter the authentication.</p>",
            "<p>You can choose to have high-risk purchases do this authorization, or you can opt for certain car users to go through the process.</p>",

            "<p>There are many benefits of using a 3D secure system that will protect both the merchant and the users. This can also save you money and shift liability away from your business.</p>",
            "<h3>Save Money</h3>",
            "<p>When you have a secure way for people to pay with their cards, then you can save money. You\u2019ll have fewer chargebacks, which also means that you\u2019ll have more money in your business account.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll also save time and money on resources for disputing claims, paying fees, and paying any penalties. However, you could lower your conversion rate.</p>",
            "<p>In general, if a checkout process is very lengthy, the customer might abandon the cart and decide not to make a sale. If you add another authentication step, this can hurt your overall shopping experience.</p>",
            "<h4>Liability</h4>",
            "<p>The payment liability is another benefit of using this type of merchant. When you complete this extra authentication step, the bank then becomes liable for any fake chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>Even when a customer says that they have an unauthorized payment on their card, the card provider will have to manage the refund.</p>",
            "<p>The merchants also benefit from not being liable anymore. There is even 3DS 2.0 that has different coverage as well. However, you\u2019re only covered if the authentication is successful and if an actual fraud-based chargeback is filed.</p>",
            "<h4>Support</h4>",
            "<p>3DS version 1 was not compatible when people purchased things on their mobile devices. However, 3D secure 2.0 lets merchants integrate this protocol into mobile apps.</p>",
            "<p>You can use this application on browsers as well, for mobile or desktops. Consumers can even use credit cards that are in some of the in-app or digital wallets.</p>",
            "<p>3DS 2 also allows non-payment authentication options. This will let you validate the cardholder without having them actually purchase something.</p>",
            "<h5>How to Set Up a 3D Secure Payment System</h5>",
            "<p>If you want to use any of these benefits, you\u2019ll need to set up this 3DS. You can either set it up yourself or use another company to set it up for you.</p>",
            "<p>If you have someone set up the account for you, they\u2019ll set up a merchant account. This will be separate from a business bank account, but it\u2019ll be an area where all the payment funds will be held and processed.</p>",
            "<p>There, you can access them and transfer them to your business bank, knowing that all of those payments were valid and legitimate.</p>",
            "<p>This company will also add a layer of security to your payment methods. They\u2019ll also ensure that you meet all of the<a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/\">PCI-compliant measures</a>. This will ensure that you\u2019re processing, transmitting, and storing customer data in the right way.</p>",
            "<h4>Learn More About Why You Should Use 3D Secure</h4>",

            "<p>Although it is difficult to get accurate figures on the overall size of the worldwide adult industry, the pornography industry alone was approaching $100 billion in revenue as early as 2006. If we assume that the other areas of the adult industry are also bringing in billions of dollars every year, we are talking about a truly massive industry with a truly massive market. Technological developments such as the Internet and virtual reality continue to give it more avenues for growth. Which makes the need for adult merchant payment processing all the more necessary.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What is an Adult Business?</h2>",
            "<p>The term \u201cadult industry\u201d covers a very broad range of products and services, and in its vagueness might not be the most helpful in understanding what exactly we\u2019re talking about. However, as Kristen N. Jozkowski writes in<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118896877\"><em>The International Encyclopedia of Human Sexuality</em></a>, \u201cadult industry generally refers to the sale of sexually explicit material or services, including legal and illegal exchanges, for profit in commercial marketplaces.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>As Jozkowski later points out, most of the adult industry consists of what is often referred to as \u201cadult entertainment.\u201d However, it ranges from sexually oriented toys to pornography to sexually explicit stage shows and live video streaming to phone sex and prostitution in all of its various forms. Some of the most common types of business operating legally in the adult industry are as follows.</p>",
            "<p>If you are operating any of these types of business, or other related/similar types of business, one challenge that you have to deal with is that the adult industry is considered to be high risk by most banks and other financial institutions. That complicates the establishment and operation of your business, and increases the number and weight of demands on you and your business, in terms of both money and time.</p>",
            "<h3>What Makes Payment Processing in the Adult Industry High Risk?</h3>",
            "<p>So, what is it that makes banks and other financial institutions view the adult industry\u2014or more specifically, opening merchant accounts and processing payments for the adult industry\u2014as high risk? The two most common reasons that a company is labeled \u201chigh-risk business\u201d are a high chargeback rate and a high frequency of fraud. These both apply to the adult industry overall.</p>",
            "<p>That fact alone would likely get it placed in the high risk category, but there are other aspects of the industry that contribute to that categorization as well. Those aspects include:</p>",
            "<h4>High Potential for Chargebacks and Fraud</h4>",
            "<p>Every business that accepts payment by credit card must deal with the issue of chargebacks. The nature of the adult industry, however, has an additional factor that can lead to a higher rate of chargebacks than other industries. Customers in the adult industry tend to want to keep their purchases private. If they believe that they have been \u201cfound out,\u201d they may dispute charges and say that they did not purchase the product or service, etc.</p>",
            "<p>It also sometimes happens that people really do have their credit card information stolen and used to buy sexually explicit content. If the purchases are in small enough amounts, and the name of the merchant is vague enough on the billing statement, a lot of time might go by before the cardholder realizes what has happened. If it continues over a number of months, the total amount can be significant.</p>",
            "<h5>Increased Potential for \u201cFriendly\u201d Fraud</h5>",
            "<p>The adult industry also has an increased potential for<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/friendly-fraud/\">\u201cfriendly\u201d fraud</a>. For example, let\u2019s say that a teenager uses his mother\u2019s credit card, without permission, to buy pornography online. He doesn\u2019t mention it to his mother because he doesn\u2019t want to get in trouble for using the card and because he would be embarrassed if she knew that he was viewing pornography.</p>",
            "<p>When the billing statement arrives, the teenager\u2019s mother sees the purchase but doesn\u2019t recognize it. She contacts the bank or credit card company to ask about it, and finds out that the payment was made to an adult entertainment website. She might ask her son about it, but he will most likely deny knowing anything about it.</p>",
            "<p>The mother assumes that her card information has been stolen, so she disputes the charge. If she successfully initiates a chargeback, she will have unintentionally committed fraud in the sense that the purchase she disputed was actually made by someone for whom she had legal responsibility.</p>",
            "<p>This type of \u201cfriendly\u201d chargeback fraud can happen in other industries, of course, but the higher likelihood that the guilty family member, etc., will be extra secretive means that there is a higher degree of motivation to deny making the purchase in the case of the adult industry.</p>",
            "<h6>High-risk Merchant Account Registration Fees</h6>",
            "<p>Credit card companies typically charge a registration fee for high-risk merchant accounts. Ordinarily, it must be paid each year. As of this writing,<a href=\"https://www.getbankcard.com/blog/high-risk-merchant-account-fees/#h-high-risk-merchant-account-set-up-onboarding\">Visa and MasterCard charge $500</a>per year. Some credit card companies do not have a set annual registration/renewal fee, but will require payment of other fees based on the number of payments that are processed and other factors.</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to check with the credit card company and your payment processor for specific requirements and other details.</p>",
            "<h4>Legal Issues for Adult Industry Payment Processing</h4>",
            "<p>Political/social debate and controversy tend to surround the adult industry, and there are often legal requirements and restrictions placed on businesses in the industry that are not placed on businesses in other industries. Compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards has become a major pressing issue in every industry, and the United States is especially strict toward the adult industry.</p>",
            "<p>Some of the requirements may even be somewhat unexpected. For example, it\u2019s not surprising that there are laws and regulations that prohibit the sale of pornography to minors. Merchants in the adult industry usually understand that and take it into consideration when starting their business. On the other hand, they are much less likely to be aware that there are laws that set requirements for something like record-keeping related to simulated sexual conduct (<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2257A\">U.S. Code \u00a7 2257A</a>).</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to look into the relevant laws and regulations thoroughly and make compliance a priority in your business.

            "<p>A high-risk payment processor can be a highly effective resource in helping you get things set up in a way that your adult merchant payment processing will be in compliance with laws and regulations from the start. Because the payment processor specializes in high-risk businesses, it can help strengthen your protection against risks that are specific to your industry and that could do serious damage. The ideal is to find a high-risk payment processor that has a good level of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-adult/\">experience in payment processing, etc., for the adult industry</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The penalties for non-compliance can be significant, and violation of relevant laws could result in having your merchant account closed, leaving you without a way for customers to make payments. Ask as many questions as you need. Neither your business nor the payment processor will benefit from a bad match between your needs and the processor\u2019s capabilities.</p>",

            "<p>Although there is great potential for success, online gaming merchant accounts face a number of complex and difficult issues. One such issue arises at the most basic level: the name of the industry. Online or otherwise, \u201cgaming\u201d means different things to different people. If you were to ask a typical American teenager what \u201cgaming\u201d means, the response would likely be something along the lines of \u201cplaying video games.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, a sixty-year-old man is likely to mention some type of gambling. In fact, in legal terminology, \u201cgaming\u201d almost always refers to gambling. Organizations that oversee matters related to gambling are often referred to as \u201cgaming commissions.\u201d Rules and regulations that apply to the gambling industry are collectively referred to as \u201cgaming law.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Gaming law is not a specific branch of law, per se, but can be criminal law, corporate law, contract law, regulatory law, constitutional law, international business law, competition law, or administrative law that deals with matters related to gambling. In addition, generally speaking, \u201conline gaming\u201d refers to online gambling, while \u201conline game\u201d refers to a video game that is played via the Internet, complicating the matter further.</p>",
            "<p>To avoid confusion, in this article, the word \u201cgaming\u201d refers only to the various types of gambling, and does not include video games that do not involve gambling.</p>",

Most businesses open accounts at a traditional bank, but traditional banks and payment processing companies tend to be reluctant to provide services to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">businesses that are considered to be high risk</a>.</p>",

            "<p>There are other aspects of online gaming that make traditional banks and payment processors hesitant to provide a merchant account, as well. Although defined in part as a type of entertainment or leisure activity, most forms of gaming are considered by the general public and the legal system to be gambling. Along with the mixed image that gives to gaming, gambling is illegal in some states and other areas of the world.</p>",
            "<h2>New Technology Means New Benefits and New Risks</h2>",
            "<p>In addition, although gambling itself has been around for many centuries,<em>online</em>gambling did not even exist in any meaningful form three or four decades ago. It was made possible by the creation of the Internet, which, despite now being widespread and a normal part of everyday life, is still a very new technology that continues to change dramatically. Among other things, this means that new security measures are being developed and implemented all the time.</p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, the newness and rapidly occurring changes introduce new risks and vulnerabilities. If they are not eliminated, or at least reduced as much as possible, the business, the payment processor (such as the bank providing the merchant account), and other people connected to that network could suffer significant loss.</p>",
            "<h4>Requirements for Online Gaming Merchant Accounts</h4>",
            "<p>This, of course, means that you need a high-risk merchant account. You will need to find a payment processor that is willing to take on clients that are high-risk businesses and that has knowledge and experience in high-risk payment processing, the infrastructure for underwriting high-risk clients, and the technological tools needed to provide timely and reliable payment processing services.</p>",

            "<p>Because laws and regulations related to online gaming can differ drastically between cities, states, and countries, online gaming businesses need a way to limit the areas from which their services can be purchased or used. Geofencing can be used to deny services automatically when an attempt to access them is made from a device that is outside an area you have authorized.</p>",
            "<p>There are, of course, ways to prevent detection, but at the very least, geofencing can make it enough of a bother that the person attempting to access your services inappropriately will move on to his or her next target.</p>",

            "<p>There are major benefits to this model. It is a recurring payment system, where a consumer will sign up for a subscription option at one time, adding his or her credit card details.</p>",
            "<p>From then on, the user will incur a charge weekly, monthly, or annually, depending on the cadence per the details of the subscription they agreed to. Usually, after a period, a customer can renew a subscription.</p>",

            "<p>If the consumer is unaware, that they signed up for a subscription, they can get aggravated when they see the charges the next month. This becomes the challenging part.</p>",

            "<p>Here are some more disadvantages that come along with a subscription business model and solutions to overcome these challenges.</p>",
            "<h3>Increasing Competition</h3>",
            "<p>No doubt that this is a popular business model, which also means you have competition. With more competitors offering subscriptions, you risk losing a valued customer. Don\u2019t let this discourage you, it just means you need more than a subscription to set you apart.</p>",
            "<p>You need a unique brand identity and value proposition to make your company stand out from the pack. Customers prefer working with merchants who have impeccable customer service. The human connection is important, even if billing is automatic.</p>",

            "<h3>Avoiding Your Sign-Up Agreement</h3>",
            "<p>When there is no commitment, it is much easier for a customer to agree to a one-time purchase. If unsatisfied, they can return their purchase and get their money back.</p>",
            "<p>Things are not so simple with a contract, though, which is why customers can fear signing a service agreement. Customers are hesitant to commit if they are unsure they will receive value. The last thing a customer wants is to be stuck in a contract they are not happy with.</p>",

High risk processors understand the subtleties involved with opening a bank account for businesses in unique verticals. Moreover, they share all of the details and legal regulations around payment processing in your industry.</p>",
            "<p>On your Shopify store, you can sell many different types of products including hemp-derived CBD. Shopify only limits you based on the laws of the places you are selling.

            "<p>If you\u2019re waiting for payment processing at other companies, then there may be an issue with your compliance. Often this is due to either what you\u2019re selling, or your business history.

I Need a Payment Processor for my CBD Business!\u201d it is likely that you already know either how difficult it is to open a merchant account at a traditional bank or how easy it is to get it shut down. Possibly both. In either case, unless you only accept cash payments (which is unlikely in 2022), you don\u2019t have a way to receive payments from your customers. If you can\u2019t receive payments, your business isn\u2019t really, well, doing business, is it?</p>",
            "<p>But, you already know that. In fact, you\u2019re probably painfully aware of it. Thus, the cry for help.</p>",
            "<p>So, let\u2019s take a look at how you got into this situation and how you can get out of it.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>It All Comes Down to the Risk</h2>",
            "<p>Most traditional banks and payment processors avoid providing merchant accounts to businesses that are particularly susceptible to risks that could cost them a lot of money. When they do provide services to such businesses, the approval process is longer and more rigorous than for other businesses.</p>",
            "<p>In addition, the requirements for keeping the merchant account will be particularly strict. A chargeback rate that is perfectly normal\u2014or even low\u2014for your industry could get your account canceled suddenly and without warning.</p>",
            "<p>For a variety of reasons, CBD-related businesses are considered to be \u201c<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">high-risk businesses</a>,\u201d which makes it difficult, and often impossible, to get a traditional bank to provide a merchant account. Some of the reasons are common to most high-risk businesses. The most prevalent of these is a high<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">chargeback rate</a>.</p>",
            "<h2>Problematic Legal Standing</h2>",
            "<p>One of the reasons that is unique to CBD businesses is the problematic and ever-changing<a href=\"https://cfah.org/cbd-legal-states/\">legal standing of CBD</a>. Laws and regulations related to CBD and other cannabis-related substances differ between countries and even between states and individual local municipalities. The significant confusion this causes increases the risk of inadvertently violating laws and regulations.</p>",
            "<p>It is also important to keep in mind that the issue of CBD is a highly emotional issue for many people, which adds to the instability and unpredictability of developments. It\u2019s not really surprising that banks would rather just stay out of it, since they typically don\u2019t have the expertise and experience needed to deal with the unique needs of the industry.</p>",
            "<h2>Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Another reason is the high occurrence of fraud. Despite significant decriminalization, there is still noticeable involvement of organized crime and gangs in the growing, processing, and distribution of cannabis in some regions. Naturally, this opens the way for various types of fraud.</p>",
            "<p>As mentioned, a high chargeback rate is one of the most common reasons that businesses are viewed as high risk, and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\">fraudulent chargebacks</a>\u2014or at least chargebacks of questionable legitimacy\u2014are not rare. Even when they are legitimate and reasonable, chargebacks cost merchants and banks significant amounts of time and money. The potential losses are multiplied when actual fraud is involved.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"HELP! I Need a Payment Processor for my CBD Business!\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dreamstime_s_227561254.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>How to Get a Merchant Account</h2>",
            "<p>The legal standing and public perception of CBD and related products are expected to change, but traditional banks and payment processors will probably continue to see the CBD industry as high risk for the foreseeable future. Having a knowledgeable and reliable<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\">high-risk payment processor</a>can help your business run smoothly and in the midst of changing laws and regulations. Other benefits of using a high-risk payment processor include a lower risk of having your merchant account closed suddenly, access to a network of financial institutions that are willing and able to work with your business, multiple payment methods, and enhanced security.</p>",
            "<p>Even before applying for a merchant account, you should make sure that everything has been arranged for your business to operate legally, such as obtained the required licenses (e.g., licenses to grow, process, or sell CBD products), certificates indicating that your growers/suppliers and other have the proper licenses, etc., and documentation of the results of testing by an accredited third-party laboratory (e.g., a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-certificate-of-analysis/\">COA</a>).</p>",
            "<p>When you apply for a merchant account, you should have the following documents and information with you or readily available. The payment processor may ask for other documents as well, but these are a good start.</p>",
            "<h2>Be Honest and Frank</h2>",
            "<p>Hiding the nature of your business thinking that it will help you get your application approved will ultimately affect your business and the payment processor negatively. In short, it\u2019s a very bad idea, from legal, practical, and ethical perspectives. If you lie about the type of business you operate and your lie is discovered, you will probably lose your account and have an even harder time finding a payment processor. Your personal reputation and the reputation of your business could be irreparably damaged.</p>",
            "<p>In addition, there are enough high-risk payment processors that specialize in the CBD industry that there is no need to lie in the first place. It is also to your benefit to take maximum advantage of their unique knowledge and experience. That\u2019s only possible if you provide them with the most accurate information possible about your actual circumstances and needs.</p>",
            "<h2>What You Need in a Payment Processor</h2>",
            "<p>Ideally,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">your payment processor</a>should have experience with the CBD industry, but it should also be flexible enough to adapt to changes in laws and regulations regarding CBD, have clearly and thoroughly indicated pricing, provide multiple options for payment processing, and clearly indicate contract terms and conditions.</p>",
            "<p>The payment processor\u2019s system should integrate well with your business\u2019 system. The payment processor must have the hardware and software needed to provide the services you need, but if their system and your system don\u2019t \u201cplay\u201d together well, you could be looking at delays in processing/payment, frustrated employees, and dissatisfied (former) customers.</p>",
            "<p>Your payment processor should also provide good, reliable customer service that is available any time it is needed. Problems in the system delay or prevent reception of payments, which means that you are losing both time and money.</p>",
            "<h2>Clarify and Verify</h2>",
            "<p>A high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>specializes in payment processing for high-risk industries and understands the payment processing needs and challenges of the CBD industry. We have the experience and expertise necessary not only to get you a merchant account, but also to make the payment process easier for your customers and for you.</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to ask as many questions as necessary until you\u2019re satisfied with the responses and clear on what you can expect and what will be expected of you.

            "<p>You have started your business and intend to provide goods and/or services on a regular basis, possibly on a fixed schedule. You get customers to sign up to participate for a certain period of time, for a certain fee, etc. In other words, the customers \u201csubscribe\u201d to your products/services in a subscription business model.</p>",
            "<p>All that you need now is a merchant account so your company can get paid. You go to your local bank and try to open a merchant account, but, unfortunately, your request is denied. You find out that your very legal and very ethical subscription-type business is \u201chigh risk.\u201d So, are subscription merchant accounts considered high risk? If so, why?</p>",
            "<p>The short answer to the first question is \u201cYes.\u201d Banks and other financial institutions usually view subscription-type operation as a high-risk business. Let\u2019s take a look at why.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What is a Subscription Model?</h2>",
            "<p>First, what are we talking about specifically when we say \u201csubscription model\u201d? Subscription-type businesses have been around in one form or another for a long time. Many of those forms seem very ordinary. For example, during most of the past century, receiving daily delivery of a newspaper was pretty much an expected part of everyday American life. The delivery boy didn\u2019t collect payment each day, but would instead come around once a month to get the monthly payment for your subscription.</p>",
            "<p>Another common subscription-type service that was popular for many years is daily delivery of milk. Millions of Americans were visited in the early morning by the \u201cmilkman,\u201d who would place a bottle of milk on their doorstep or in a special box and collect the empty bottles from the previous day\u2019s delivery. Often, it was the dairy farmer himself who would make the delivery.</p>",
            "<h2>What is Different about Subscription Business Models Today?</h2>",
            "<p>At their core, subscription business models today are basically the same as they were in the days of early-morning milk delivery and paperboys throwing your newspaper into the bushes, onto the roof, and if you were lucky, occasionally onto your porch. The merchant provides the customer with certain goods and/or services at a set frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, when needed/requested by the customer, etc.,) for a certain period of time for a fee that covers that period of time. The merchant bills the customer based on the set frequency, rather than each time the goods/services are provided.</p>",
            "<p>The main thing that has changed is the use of increasingly sophisticated technology at all stages of the process, particularly in billing, payment, and management of delivery. One result of this is that more of the process has become automatic, and that means that the customer is less directly involved in it. If payments are made automatically or infrequently, or a lot of time passes between deliveries, customers may even be unaware (or forget) that they have subscribed.</p>",
            "<p>That isn\u2019t likely to happen if you have a paperboy throwing a newspaper into your bushes each day and pounding on your door once a month demanding payment.</p>",
            "<h3>What Makes a Subscription Business High Risk?</h3>",
            "<p>There are a variety of reasons that banks and other financial institutions consider certain businesses and industries to be high risk. One of the most common is having a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-high-risk-business-part-1/\">high chargeback rate</a>. Chargebacks cost time and money for you and for a bank providing you with a merchant account, so traditional banks and popular payment processors tend to have strict criteria for how high the chargeback rate can be.</p>",
            "<p>A high chargeback rate is often the factor that gets applications for subscription merchant accounts denied. Even if you manage to open a merchant account, going over the limit set by the bank could get your account closed, quickly and without warning. If that happens, you can no longer accept payments by credit card, etc., so if that his how your customers usually pay, your revenue stops. That\u2019s the one thing that we definitely<em>don</em><em>\u2019t</em>want to happen.</p>",
            "<h2>Subscriptions and Chargebacks</h2>",
            "<p>What is it about subscription-type businesses that results in a higher rate of chargebacks? At the foundation of the answer is the nature of subscriptions as a recurring business model. While a subscription for goods or services has many benefits, including convenience, of course, it also introduces certain risks.</p>",
            "<p>The simple fact that goods/services are provided repeatedly and regularly increases the opportunities for a customer to be dissatisfied or have some other reason to demand a refund. That translates into an increase in the number of cases of customers actually initiating a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>As mentioned, the use credit cards and other cashless payment methods, as well as the adoption of increasingly sophisticated technology for billing, etc., have made the process more automatic. The customer is less directly involved in it. Being able to set payments to be made regularly for goods or services that are provided regularly is very convenient, but it also makes it easy to forget about the subscription, especially if delivery or billing are done infrequently.</p>",
            "<p>A common scenario is that the customer subscribes to some service, forgets about it, and is surprised when a charge shows up on a monthly statement. Sometimes customers will panic and contact the bank directly to get the charge reversed instead of contacting the business. If they contact you to resolve the issue, it won\u2019t be counted as a chargeback. It\u2019s just a simple refund, etc. However, if they go directly to the bank and demand a refund, it ends up as a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>The Code of Federal Regulations defines a negative option plan as \u201ca contractual plan or arrangement under which a seller periodically sends to subscribers an announcement which identifies merchandise (other than annual supplements to previously acquired merchandise) it proposes to send to subscribers to such plan, and the subscribers thereafter receive and are billed for the merchandise identified in each such announcement, unless by a date or within a time specified by the seller with respect to each such announcement the subscribers, in conformity with the provisions of such plan, instruct the seller not to send the identified merchandise.\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-425#p-425.1(c)(1)\">Code of Federal Regulations Title 16, Chapter 1, Subchapter D, Part 425, Section425.1(c)(1)</a>)</p>",
            "<p>In more understandable language, it means that consumers get regular shipments (or services) at a set rate until they cancel the agreement. It is also called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2016/09/negative-options-make-them-positive\">negative option continuity plan</a>.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>The benefit of that type of plan is that the customer does not have to acknowledge or approve delivery on each occasion. They receive the products or services automatically. That\u2019s also the drawback of that type of plan. The merchant keeps sending stuff until the customer tells the merchant to stop, and if automatic payment used, payment continues as well.</p>",
            "<p>People in general tend to ignore the small print in agreements, and merchants sometimes neglect to make it clear that the customer is agreeing to a subscription, or what the specific terms of the agreement are. In both cases, the customer may initiate a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>Although the nature of subscriptions means that there is a higher risk of chargebacks, there are a variety of things that you can do to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-reduce-your-chargeback-rate/\">reduce your business\u2019 chargeback rate</a>and keep it at a minimum.</p>",
            "<h3>Newness of the Subscription Industry</h3>",
            "<p>As mentioned at the beginning, subscription-type businesses themselves have been around for a long time. Credit cards and other types of cashless payment and the sheer number of subscription-type businesses are what is new. The subscription industry is expanding and becoming more diverse, so the newness is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. That newness means that there are many unknowns for traditional banks, etc., which in turn means that they will be more reluctant to take on your business as a client.</p>",
            "<h2>What Can You Do for Your Subscription Merchant Account?</h2>",
            "<p>One thing that you absolutely must do is to get a solid understanding of the laws and regulations that apply to subscriptions, such as the<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/section-425.1\">rules of prenotification</a>. Be sure to get appropriate legal advice from a competent attorney.</p>",
            "<p>Another thing that you will likely need to do is to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\">open a high-risk merchant account</a>.

The recommended way to deal with that challenge is usually to use an<a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/economics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/independent-sales-organization-iso\">independent sales organization</a>(ISO) as your payment processor. A good question, then, is \u201cWhy use an ISO for credit card processing rather than working directly with a bank?\u201d</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What is an Independent Sales Organization (ISO)?</h2>",
            "<p>Banks tend to be reluctant to take on<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\">high-risk businesses</a>as clients. There\u2019s nothing surprising about that. The system is set up in a way that means the bank is taking on certain obligations and liabilities when providing a merchant account and payment processing services to a merchant. If things go badly, the bank could lose a lot of money and have its reputation seriously damaged.</p>",
            "<p>An independent sales organization (ISO)\u2014also known as a \u201cmerchant service provider\u201d (MSP)\u2014is essentially a middleman between the bank and the merchant, a risk-reducing extra layer of security, in a sense. An ISO for credit card processing works with banks to get a merchant account for your business when the bank is unwilling to provide it directly. The ISO assumes a large part of the obligations and liabilities that the bank would have taken on. That makes it less risky for the bank to provide services, in turn making the bank less reluctant to provide a merchant account and services. That\u2019s critical if you are running a high-risk business.</p>",
            "<p>The ISO creates partnerships with various banks, and acts as an agent of those banks to provide services to your business, while at the same time representing your business in the interaction with the bank.</p>",
            "<h3>What are the Main Services Provided by an ISO?</h3>",
            "<p>As a kind of hybrid representative of both your business and the bank, what does an ISO do? What are the main services that are provided by an ISO?</p>",
            "<p>Each payment processor is a little different, but the main things that an ISO does are getting your business a merchant account, arranging and/or conducting payment processing, and setting up and/or serving as a payment gateway. Some ISOs also provide the hardware needed to process payments, point-of-sale systems,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/wordpress-payment-gateway/\">online shopping systems</a>, and merchant financing.</p>",
            "<p>The use of cash for purchases, etc., has been decreasing for many years, and the use of credit cards and other non-cash methods of making payments has increased accordingly. McKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-2021-mckinsey-global-payments-report\">2021 McKinsey Global Payments Report</a>\u201d points out that the COVID-19 \u201cpandemic accelerated ongoing declines in cash usage and adoption of electronic and e-commerce transaction methods.\u201d Much of that has remained even as daily life has gradually gotten back to normal. It\u2019s likely that the trend toward cashless transactions will continue.</p>",
            "<p>Not surprisingly, that has increased the need and the demand for an ISO for credit card processing.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"Using an ISO for payment processing offers great customer service\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2-ISO-customer-service.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>The Benefits of Using an ISO for Credit Card Processing</h2>",
            "<p>There are significant advantages to using an ISO even in the case of businesses that are not considered to be high risk. The benefits are even greater for high-risk businesses.<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">High-risk</a>payment processors have fewer legal and regulatory restrictions than traditional banks. That enables them to provide services to merchants with low credit ratings, for example.</p>",
            "<p>That makes it possible for your high-risk business to obtain the equipment needed to process credit cards and accept payment using a broad range of credit cards/debit cards. Many services are provided remotely and electronically. The ISO also takes care of things such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-navigate-pci-compliance-in-2022/\">compliance with PCI DSS</a>, and other technical matters.</p>",
            "<p>A high-risk payment processor can also save you money. The ISO will need to be paid a fee, of course, but it will free you from the inefficient and wasteful use of time on things that are not your specialty. More of your time and other resources can be dedicated to growing your business.</p>",
            "<p>Because payment processing firms are usually relatively small, your business is more likely to get attentive personal attention. You typically won\u2019t have to wait a long time for issues to be addressed, and the services will be designed to meet your specific needs.</p>",
            "<h3>All ISOs Are Not All the Same</h3>",
            "<p>Just as in any other industry, ISOs are not all the same. There are, of course, differences in the quality of the services and how well the companies are managed, but even two payment processors of similar quality can be very different. The experience, specialization, and approach of one of the payment processors may be exactly what your business needs, but the other might be a very bad fit. A non-high-risk ISO may be great for most things, but a disaster for high-risk businesses.</p>",
            "<p>There are fewer high-risk payment processors than traditional banks and processors, but as mentioned earlier, the demand is growing, so you can expect an increase in the number in the near future. When selecting potential payment processors, be sure to ask questions and get clarification of anything you don\u2019t understand. It will be a partnership, so pay attention to gaining a mutual understanding of expectations, requirements, and the details of services.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s important to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/getting-a-merchant-account-for-a-high-risk-business/\">find an ISO</a>that has a wide range of technological tools, a solid commitment to thorough<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-navigate-pci-compliance-in-2022/\">compliance</a>with laws, regulations, and industry standards, and a secure payment system and gateway. A good ISO can alleviate many of your concerns about security and fraud. It can even help automate and streamline your business. Ultimately, that will do much to help you save money and retain customers.</p>",
            "<h2>A Broad Network of Partnerships</h2>",
            "<p>Although it will often act in stead of a bank, a payment processor is not a bank. While using an ISO for credit card processing can include contracts with multiple banks, which engage in the actual handling of money.<a href=\"https://sharkprocessing.com/zen-payments-review/\">Zen Payments</a>partners with many banks that have broad approval policies and reasonable requirements. That gives you a lot more flexibility and control over decisions about your business. Be sure to do your research and ask questions until you are satisfied with the answers.

            "<h2>Why Is Tech Support High Risk?</h2>",
            "<p>Technical support has many characteristics that qualify it as high risk. Below are some of the major reasons banks consider. For many of these, businesses can<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/high-risk-merchant-list/\"><b>reduce their risk profile</b></a>by increasing security and creating USA-based work locations that are locked-down from cyber attacks.</p>",
            "<ul><li><b>Offshore Labor</b>\u2013 Offshore means hiring people outside of the USA, whereas outsourcing could be a USA-based hire that\u2019s not on payroll. The dangerous part about offshore hiring is many employers will never see the people, place, work conditions, or security measures their employees utilize. Offshoring adds risk each step of the way.</li></ul>",
            "<p><b>Remote Connecting</b>\u2013 Many of the most common security breaches and cyber attacks occur through a remote connection. Connecting to anyone\u2019s personal or business computer, leaves them extremely vulnerable to threats. Because of this payment processors are very careful when it comes to onboarding new accounts in the tech servicing space.</p>",
            "<h2>Best Merchant Account For Tech Support</h2>",
            "<p>The<b>top tech support merchant account providers</b>for tech support will give you the ability to accept credit card payments with a sustainable account. Each of the major merchant account providers offer different benefits and features to their merchant account, but the top ones have the following.</p>",
            "<p>Top 5 Features of The Best Tech Support Merchant Account:</p>",
            "<ul><li><b>Fraud Protection</b>\u2013 Going hand-in-hand with chargeback reduction is fraud protection. This is because fraud is a common cause for chargebacks. And with both, identifying problematic transactions is key. However, there are other ways fraud can harm a business. For example, friendly fraud is when a customer claims they didn\u2019t receive a service (when they did) and they either ask for a refund or file a chargeback. Recognizing buying patterns or historically malicious accounts is your key to staying protected from fraudulent transactions.</li></ul>",
            "<ul><li><b>Low Fees</b>\u2013 Most merchants don\u2019t know, but fees are negotiable. Your payment processor is providing you a much needed service, but the rate should not be egregious. Talk with your sales person and discuss the standard rates for your merchant account to see if you can lower the cost. Top payment processors will work with you to gain your business. This means compromising on fees as well as reworking the way your fee structure operates. For example, you may want to lower transaction costs while maintaining overall percentages or vice versa.</li></ul>",
            "<p><b>Fast or Automatic Approvals</b>\u2013 Speed is always an important factor in the financial sphere. The faster you get your account approved, the sooner you\u2019ll be able to start selling through your new account. And more importantly, you\u2019ll have access to profits or investment funds to grow your business. Your payment processing comping should be able to gather all of the underwriting information they need quickly and approve on the spot. Top companies have automated services that do this immediately for low risk businesses. However, because tech support is high risk there may be a short waiting time while they review your information manually.</p>",

In the USA, there are many governing bodies who ensure digital transactions are secure. Moreover, these agencies have regulations and enforce standards when it comes to how businesses operate in the payments space.</p>",
            "<p>The Automated Clearing House or ACH is in charge of regulating standards and enforcing safe transactions for customers. On the other hand, major card providers like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express operate on the trust. As long as customers trust credit cards, they can continue to operate. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve implemented stricter standards over the years and hold banks and businesses accountable to them.</p>",

Both of these steps are the merchant\u2019s responsibility to provide, and what you don\u2019t want to do next is to wait on your merchant account company to process papers or take time underwriting.

            "<h2>What Is a Continuity Credit Card Processor?</h2>",
            "<p>A continuity credit card processor is used for businesses that use recurring payments or subscription billing. The consumer will be charged monthly for services or products that they\u2019ve signed up to receive.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll have to define your terms and conditions, and a consumer will have to accept those terms. The billing will only stop when they unsubscribe. Businesses can use this payment method, and they don\u2019t have to be a high-risk merchant.</p>",
            "<p>These businesses are normally<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\">high risk</a>because some of them will misuse this type of business, and it can lead to billing scams that will lose the customer\u2019s trust. It will also charge customers for things that they weren\u2019t aware that they might be charged for, which means that there can be a lot of chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>Common businesses that will use this type of merchant account are food delivery, newspapers, magazines, subscription boxes, membership sites, food delivery, or streaming accounts.</p>",
            "<h2>How Do They Work?</h2>",

Any business can use this.</p>",
            "<p>While this can be great for bringing in stable revenue, many businesses will charge for products or services that they aren\u2019t providing to a customer. However, a dependable merchant account provider will help reduce the risk that is associated with risks and chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>Subscription-based businesses can use the right merchant to overcome these risks.</p>",
            "<h2>Risks With a Continuity Payment System</h2>",
            "<p>A good payment system will help reduce these risks and make it operate like a traditional banking system. The customer\u2019s card will get charged with the recurring payment until they cancel their subscription.</p>",
            "<p>However, merchants need to inform customers of the transactions so that they are aware of them. If they don\u2019t, they could run into legal issues.</p>",
            "<p>However, a lot of customers will claim that there are issues with these systems, which can include the number of chargebacks. If there are too many chargebacks, a bank could lose its money, so these models are seen as risks for banks.</p>",
            "<p>While it\u2019s great to have reliable monthly income, customers could cancel their subscriptions at any point. You need to ensure that you have a good way to retain customers.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll need to account for some customer turnover, but you also need to figure out how you will keep your customers coming back for more. There are many different ways to keep your customers, and it can start with offering good customer service or offering new and updated products and services.</p>",
            "<p>And while it might seem counterintuitive, make sure that you have a clear cancellation policy. If there isn\u2019t enough information, your customers might start to panic and cancel their subscriptions. Or even worse, they may never even sign up.</p>",
            "<h2>How to Find a Continuity Card Processor</h2>",
            "<p>You should search for the right merchant account but there are many factors that you\u2019ll want to consider before you sign a contract with them. For example, how is their customer service?</p>",
            "<p>When you\u2019re relying on them to get your income and deal with customers, then you want to ensure that you\u2019ll be able to reach out to someone if something isn\u2019t working. If they don\u2019t have anyone who can help you or are ignoring your requests for initial information, then you may want to find a different processor.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll also want to ask about their fee structure. You don\u2019t want to sign a contractor who has hidden fees and find out that you\u2019ll end up owing even more money. Keep in mind that while the fees might not seem like a lot while your business is growing, as you get more sales, it will start to add up.</p>",
            "<p>Those fees that weren\u2019t important beforehand could cost you thousands of dollars each month for every renewed subscription. This can be even worse if you have hidden fees that you didn\u2019t know about until it\u2019s too late.</p>",
            "<p>Lastly, make sure that your merchant can use technology that integrates easily with your business tools. If you have a merchant that uses different tools, then you\u2019ll have to pay even more to get a tool that you wouldn\u2019t normally use.</p>",
            "<p>Make sure that you have some values that are aligned and that you fully understand the contract and any fees. Most of these merchants will require that you sign a long-term contract, so you should know everything about the company before you sign that.</p>",
            "<p>There are normally fees associated with breaking those contracts, so find a processor that you enjoy working with</p>",

            "<h1>Are There Stripe Restricted Businesses?</h1>",
            "<p>Since its initial inception in 2011, Stripe has become one of the world\u2019s leading payment processor solutions for web-based businesses. Currently,<a href=\"https://backlinko.com/stripe-users\">3.1 million businesses</a>use Stripe worldwide.</p>",
            "<p>Although Stripe has become a go-to solution for businesses of all sizes, it has a couple of drawbacks. If your company falls under the list of Stripe restricted businesses, you might be barred from creating a merchant account. Or worse, you could have your account (and the funds in it) frozen for multiple months.</p>",
            "<p>This is a disaster for any business, especially during times of growth.</p>",
            "<p>If you were wondering, are there Stripe restricted businesses, the answer is a resounding yes.</p>",
            "<p>Are you worried that your business might be restricted by Stripe?</p>",
            "<p>Keep reading to find out what might classify you as a restricted company, and what you can do.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Why Stripe Might Categorize Your Business Under Its List of Restricted Companies</h2>",
            "<p>Stripe prohibits businesses from using its services for various types of activities it deems illegal or high-risk. These restrictions are in place to protect Stripe from liability.</p>",
            "<p>For instance, back in 2020<a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/payment-processor-to-pay-120000-in-connection-with-cryptocurrency-scheme\">Stripe was found liable</a>to the tune of $120,000 for processing payments in connection with a fraudulent ICO. Court processes deemed that Stripe\u2019s risk monitoring and fraud prevention and mitigation practices violated consumer protection law.</p>",
            "<p>To guard against these liabilities, Stripe forbids the use of its services for activities that could be high-risk.</p>",
            "<p>Unfortunately, these restrictions can make it very difficult for certain types of legitimate businesses to safely process payments with Stripe. If something raises a red flag on your account, it could be suspended at a moment\u2019s notice, and any funds frozen for at least 90 days.</p>",
            "<p>To help you avoid this type of disaster here is a breakdown of some of the criteria around Stripe restricted businesses.</p>",
            "<h2>Your Business Falls Under Stripe's Jurisdiction Restrictions</h2>",
            "<p>If your business is located in a Stripe restricted jurisdiction you won\u2019t be able to create a merchant account. These jurisdictions include:</p>",
            "<h2>You Have a High Chargeback History</h2>",
            "<p>If your business has suffered a number of chargebacks, this can also cause you to fall onto Stripe\u2019s list of restricted companies. High chargeback frequencies can make payment processors see your business as a financial risk.</p>",
            "<p>This is perhaps one of the most unfair reasons for which businesses get their accounts frozen.</p>",
            "<p>It is true that fraudulent businesses may experience high numbers of chargebacks from unhappy customers. However, many entirely legitimate businesses also fall victim to chargebacks. Chargeback fraud has exploded over the last few years and has blossomed into a costly problem for eCommerce companies.</p>",
            "<p>Currently, it\u2019s estimated that<a href=\"https://www.paymentsjournal.com/chargeback-fraud-101/\">60-76% of all disputes</a>are cases of friendly fraud.</p>",
            "<p>Unfortunately, although they are the victims, businesses get penalized for friendly fraud through account freezing, fees, and penalties from their payment processors.</p>",
            "<h2>Your Business Model Is Deemed High-Risk</h2>",
            "<p>Stripe also restricts certain business models. For instance, if you run a subscription model or continuity program, Stripe might deem this as high-risk.</p>",
            "<p>This is another area where a lot of large payment processors have fallen behind the times. Subscription models have boomed over the last few years, offering convenience for customers and predictable revenue for businesses.</p>",
            "<p>Another common practice that could have your Stripe account frozen is the free trial model. Free trials can trigger a certain number of chargebacks, which in turn can place a red flag over your account.</p>",
            "<h2>Most of Your Payments Are Card-Not-Present Transactions</h2>",
            "<p>Do you run an eCommerce-only business model? If so, there\u2019s a good chance that the majority of your revenue comes from card-not-present online payments where customers enter their card details to complete purchases.</p>",
            "<p>Unfortunately, this is yet another thing that can place you into the \u201chigh-risk\u201d category for payment processors like Stripe.</p>",
            "<h2>You Have a High Refund Rate</h2>",
            "<p>Like chargebacks, high refund rates can indicate that a business isn\u2019t acting ethically. However, in this day and age of online shopping, customers may purchase items online on a whim, and only make their final buying decision once they receive the item.</p>",
            "<p>This means that certain eCommerce sellers typically experience high return rates, especially for items such as clothing or homeware.</p>",
            "<h2>Stripe Doesn't Support Your Industry</h2>",
            "<p>Besides these general reasons for denying the use of their service Stripe also has a list of restricted industries. If your business operates in any of the following industries, you won\u2019t be able to use Stripe:</p>",
            "<p>Stripe also has a list of additional jurisdiction-specific prohibitions. For instance, if your business is based in Thailand, you aren\u2019t allowed to use Stripe to accept payments for vitamin products, psychic services, alcohol sales, and more.</p>",
            "<h2>What Stripe Restricted Businesses Can Do</h2>",
            "<p>Does your business fall under any of the above categories? If yes, you need to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\">find a payment processor</a>that supports your business needs and won\u2019t freeze your account for erroneous reasons.</p>",
            "<p>The good news is that there are many alternatives out there that will accommodate high-risk merchants. The bad news is that not all these options are created equal.</p>",
            "<p>Some merchant processing services charge exorbitant rates because they know merchants are desperate for a solution. Others might have poor support levels or lengthy turnaround times for deposits.</p>",
            "<p>Sifting through your options can be incredibly time-consuming and frustrating. Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to undertake this on your own.</p>",

            "<h2>What Does the Payment Process Involve?</h2>",

            "<p>Since this data is sensitive, using a payment processor with strong security is essential. For example, the payment gateway should always be encrypted. This protects both you and your customers.</p>",
            "<p>After the customer inputs the relevant data, the payment has to go through a confirmation process. Part of the approval also has to come from the customer\u2019s bank or card issuer.</p>",
            "<p>The last step involves sending the funds to your account. This will include the entirety of the transaction minus the fees associated with the payment processor.</p>",

            "<p>This virtual terminal gives you a wide range of tools and services, such as sending invoices, confirming AVS and CVV responses, and signing your customers up for recurring plans. The terminal can also create detailed financial reports so that you have reliable information you can use to double-check a specific transaction, make helpful projections, and much more.</p>",

This allows you to stay competitive and attract even more customers due to your ease of use.</p>",
            "<h2>How Much Will a Payment Processor Cost Me?</h2>",
            "<p>The cost of payment processing can fluctuate based on a wide range of factors, including the type of provider you choose, the type of products you\u2019re selling, and much more. Since CBD oil is considered high-risk, the prices are a bit higher than a product that isn\u2019t labeled as such.</p>",
            "<p>When taking advantage of a payment processor, there tend to be two different sets of fees. The first type of fee is a subscription that gives you and your customers access to the software. The second type of fee is a percentage of each transaction.</p>",
            "<p>The subscription cost could come with a month-to-month fee that\u2019s as low as $10 or as much as $20, if not more. The percentage of each transaction can range from two to three percent, as well as a $0.10 to $0.30 add-on fee.</p>",
            "<p>You should also remember the cost of setting up your payment portal account. This one-time fee can end up costing anywhere from $750 to $1,250.</p>",
            "<p>To get the best deal possible, it\u2019s worth researching and comparing quotes from different payment processing providers. The key is to weigh the cost of the service against its quality and reliability. The last thing you\u2019d want to do is invest in something that will crash every time it\u2019s trying to process a CBD oil payment, for instance.</p>",
            "<h2>Are Online Payments Providers Really Worth It?</h2>",
            "<p>Nowadays, there are many ways one can pay for an item online, including credit cards, bank transfers, and more. Most people buy things online using a credit card. H owever, every transaction is high-risk since the credit card is classified as not present (CNP).</p>",
            "<p>This is especially true when considering how much online fraud has recently occurred. From chargebacks to fake credit card payments, it\u2019s becoming easier and easier for cybercriminals to take advantage of honest businesses. The bigger your business grows, the higher the chance of frauds like this happening.</p>",
            "<p>As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, a high number of chargebacks can result in your account becoming frozen. This would lock you out of all the funds on that specific account. The duration of the freeze depends on a variety of factors, but even a few days could cause all kinds of issues with the operation of your business.</p>",
            "<p>A high-risk payment processor can ensure you\u2019re protected during every step. This alone is worth the investment, but you can get plenty more when you opt for a reliable CBD oil payment processor.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s also the matter of security. If you use an unreliable payment processor, your customer\u2019s data will be at risk, and they may not want to buy from you again.</p>",

            "<p>The step for getting this merchant will be very similar to applying for a loan. in general, you\u2019ll want to use a bad credit merchant if you have a low personal credit score, have a history of bankruptcy, or have some liens on your property.</p>",
            "<p>If you have a bad credit score that is 600 or less, then you\u2019re likely in the bad credit category.

Many payment companies are learning that a quicker approval process means satisfied customers.</p>",

The automated tool evaluates this information instantly and provides a predetermined outcome based on your data.</p>",
            "<p>Your merchant account will still be reviewed at a higher level but after the approval process.

            "<h3>What Types Of Merchant Accounts Are Instantly Approved?</h3>",

The standards for online businesses and physical retail stores are a bit different when it comes to creating merchant accounts. For one, your address and place of business doesn\u2019t always have to be the same location you operate. In turn, many international companies seek out automatic approvals for online businesses.</p>",
            "<p>As mentioned before, a fast approval doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a permanent merchant account.

However, the standards for the merchant account haven\u2019t changed just because the approval time decreased.</p>",

This means that one of the challenges you face is opening a merchant account and obtaining payment processing services. All businesses benefit from optimal use of their merchant accounts and high-quality payment processing, but finding the right provider of a merchant account for travel can take the benefit to the next level for your high-risk business.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Why is Your Travel Business High Risk?</h2>",
            "<p>The two most common reasons that a business is considered to be high risk are that it is in an industry that has a high rate of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">chargebacks</a>and that it is particularly susceptible to<a href=\"https://www.consumer-action.org/downloads/english/Chase_CC_Fraud_Leaders.pdf\">fraud</a>. Chargebacks and fraud are both more likely to occur when the prices of products and services are high. Transactions at a travel business are more likely to involve payments of $1,000 than a payment of only $10.00. Travel-related business now involves online transactions as a normal part of the system. Along with the many conveniences of online transactions, the reality is that it also creates more opportunities for fraud.</p>",
            "<p>In the travel industry, chargebacks are typically due to a customer changing his or her mind or because of a change in circumstances that prevents the trip. A factor unique to travel-related businesses is the extended period of time between the day that travel plans are made and the actual day of the trip. If the total cost of the trip is, say, $3,000, a wait of two or three months could very well result in a waning of your initial excitement, and you may start thinking that you should have bought a new refrigerator instead.</p>",
            "<p>The consequences of fraud and a high rate of chargebacks cost the merchant and the bank a lot of money. Banks are very reluctant to take on that risk. This makes it very difficult for travel agencies, etc., to open a merchant account at traditional banks. That does not, however, change the fact that your travel-related business has to have a way for customers to pay with credit cards/debit cards.</p>",
            "<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>",
            "<p>There are, of course, some<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\">things that you can do</a>. You can implement measures to reduce or eliminate risks, such as making return policies clear and easy to understand, providing high-quality customer service, maintaining good communication with customers, and providing refunds before customers initiate chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>Giving customers more time to make a decision about the purchase may sometimes result in a decision not to make the purchase. However, a decision made in haste or on impulse is significantly more likely to result in a chargeback and the accompanying extra cost than one that is made after more thought. Travel plans are often made far in advance, possibly months before the actual trip. That gives the customer a lot of time to develop buyer\u2019s remorse and initiate a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>In addition, a reasonable and clear refund policy will help your case in a dispute, and it will also increase the likelihood that the customer will contact you to resolve the issue instead of going directly to the bank to initiate a chargeback. A positive experience with your business providing a refund when appropriate could bring the customer back to you in the future to make a purchase that he or she is more sure of.</p>",
            "<p>Clear and attentive communication can also help prevent fraud. Fraudsters thrive on anonymity and ambiguity. Spelling out terms, conditions, deadlines, requirements, etc., clearly can eliminate opportunities for fraudsters and make it more risky to attempt a scam. Criminals shy away from risk and difficulty, and prefer the safest and easiest path, and will often abandon their plans if it seems like too much of a bother and too much of a risk.</p>",
            "<p>This won\u2019t necessarily change the fact that your business is considered to be high risk, and you will need to find an alternative to traditional banks and many popular payment processors. Obviously, the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-high-risk-payment-processor/\">payment processor you select</a>should be able to provide your customers with a payment portal and handle the standard aspects of payment processing. It should also have the equipment, software, experience, and expertise to handle the factors and challenges that are unique to the travel industry. It must be able to provide uninterrupted and accurate credit card payment processing despite the challenges.</p>",
            "<p>Your relationship with your payment processor will be a partnership, and your honesty about your circumstances and needs is vital to enabling the processor to provide the services that you need.</p>",
            "<h2>A Better Choice to Begin With</h2>",
            "<p>You may be able to find a traditional bank, etc., that is willing to provide your business with a merchant account, but it will still view your business as high risk. You will be subject to stricter requirements, lower maximum chargeback rates, and other conditions that could result in your merchant account being closed suddenly, leaving you with no way to get paid by customers. Your travel business might benefit from using a high-risk payment processor from the start.</p>",
            "<p>There are various additional benefits to utilizing a high-risk payment processor. For example, high-risk merchant accounts for travel-related businesses usually do not utilize purchase price caps, which can make it difficult for customers to make purchases. In addition, high-risk payment processors consider chargebacks to be a given due to the nature of the travel industry. This means that they have a much higher tolerance for chargebacks, significantly reducing the possibility that your account will be closed suddenly, without warning. A good payment processor will have the knowledge and experience needed to help you reduce chargebacks, and some payment processors provide chargeback management services to fight chargebacks that you believe are illegitimate.</p>",
            "<p>Not every business that asks a high-risk payment processor for a merchant account and payment processing services, of course, but because such firms specialize in high-risk industries, it will probably be much easier not only to open a merchant account, but also to keep it in good standing.</p>",

            "<p>Every business that accepts payment by credit card knows the expense in both time and money that chargebacks can cause. Chargebacks can be initiated for a variety of reasons, of course, some of which are legitimate, or at least understandable. On the other hand, some are unreasonable, questionable, or outright fraudulent. It is necessary to take steps to reduce legitimate chargebacks, of course, but it is even more important to implement solid measures to mitigate chargeback fraud.</p>",

            "<p>Strictly speaking,<a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/cas/chargback_guide.pdf\">chargebacks</a>are preventable, whether legitimate or fraudulent. If customers are never dissatisfied, or if they always contact the business directly to request a refund rather than contacting the bank to initiate a chargeback, chargebacks will not occur. However, customers will be dissatisfied at times, and will contact the bank rather than your business on many of those occasions. Although preventable, realistically speaking, chargebacks are inevitable.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s important to keep in mind that it is the<em>occurrence</em>of chargebacks, not the number, frequency, or financial impact of chargebacks that is inevitable. There are a variety of measures that can be implemented to reduce the likelihood of chargebacks. They can be made part of your policies, your customer service, or your transaction system and process. You can read about some of them<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/mitigating-inevitable-chargebacks-at-the-gate/\">here</a>.</p>",
            "<h2>Chargeback Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Considering the prevalence of credit card transactions, it should come as no surprise that there are various types of credit card fraud. Generally speaking, they fall into two categories. One can be considered to be \u201ctrue\u201d fraud and the other can be considered to be \u201cfriendly\u201d fraud.</p>",
            "<p>True fraud is<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/true-fraud/\">intentional fraud</a>. In the case of true chargeback fraud, the perpetrator makes a credit card purchase with the intention of initiating an illegitimate chargeback based on false claims. It is a conscious attempt to utilize the chargeback system to obtain personal gain that is not warranted.</p>",
            "<p>Friendly fraud is often unintentional, or at least starts out that way. There are four types of friendly fraud, with varying levels of \u201cfriendliness.\u201d</p>",
            "<p><em>Accidental/unintentional</em></p>",
            "<p>In these cases, there is no malicious intent involved and the cardholder simply makes an innocent mistake, such as forgetting about making the purchase or not recognizing a merchant name or ID on a billing statement.</p>",
            "<p><em>Customer dissatisfaction</em></p>",
            "<p>In these cases, a customer demands a refund not because there is an actual defect or deficiency with the products or services, but because he or she is somehow dissatisfied with them. In a sense, it\u2019s a \u201cgot what I wanted, but it wasn\u2019t what I wanted\u201d type of situation. The nature of some products and services leaves more room for customer claims of not getting what they paid for. Businesses that promise things that are difficult to measure are particularly susceptible to this.</p>",
            "<p><em>Family fraud</em></p>",
            "<p>In these cases, the cardholder\u2019s child, spouse, or other family member makes a purchase without the cardholder\u2019s knowledge or permission. This frequently starts out as accidental/unintentional friendly fraud, but becomes intentional when the cardholder continues to claim that the purchase was illegitimate despite finding out that the purchase was made by a family member, etc. The cardholder is no longer simply making a mistake, but is committing the crime of chargeback fraud.</p>",
            "<p><em>Malicious and intentional</em></p>",
            "<p>In these cases, the only real difference from other types of true fraud is that the fraud is committed by the actual cardholder rather than an unauthorized third party. The cardholder makes the purchase with the intention of filing a false dispute or making false claims.</p>",
            "<h2>Chargeback Countermeasures: Deluxe Version</h2>",
            "<p>Although chargeback fraud involves some factors that are not issues in the case of legitimate chargebacks, there is, fortunately, quite a bit of overlap between the countermeasures. In a sense, measures to mitigate chargeback fraud are simply the expanded or \u201cdeluxe\u201d version of standard chargeback countermeasures. In the case of chargeback fraud countermeasures, the emphasis is shifted somewhat away from making it easier for customers to get issues resolved and measures to reduce dissatisfaction to reducing or eliminating loopholes, ambiguity, and anonymity that provide opportunities for fraud to be successful.</p>",
            "<p><em>Good customer service</em></p>",
            "<p>Experienced customer service representatives will often be able to tell when something isn\u2019t quite right with a dispute. Train your staff to ask customers questions about any problematic details. That is often enough to discourage fraudsters from carrying out their plans.</p>",
            "<p><em>Good return policy</em></p>",
            "<p>A clear and explicit returns/refund policy will significantly reduce the leeway for dishonest customers to claim ignorance or find loopholes. If a dispute ends up going to court, the existence of a clear and explicit policy could be the difference between winning and losing.</p>",
            "<p><em>Clear communication</em></p>",
            "<p>Clear, consistent, and appropriately timed communication can help deter chargebacks in general, and chargeback fraud, friendly or otherwise, in particular. Sending an order confirmation, a shipping notification, a follow-up message after delivery, or other simple acts are usually enough. The more interaction you have with fraudsters, the less able they will be to remain anonymous.</p>",
            "<p><em>Tracking and confirmation of delivery</em></p>",
            "<p>A method of committing chargeback fraud that is fairly common is to claim that a product was not delivered. You can prevent, or at least deter, this by using delivery tracking/confirmation. Even if it is not possible to get a customer\u2019s signature for a delivery, many delivery companies photograph the package at the delivery point, typically from an angle that makes it possible to identify the location (e.g., angles that show the front door, the house number, etc.).</p>",

            "<p><b>Merchant processing residuals</b>are how ISOs make money in the payment processing sector. These residuals are a small percentage of the overall fees charged to merchants for the service. Each merchant agrees on the fees they will pay and within those is the leftover or \u201cresidual\u201d funds for the business that helped set up their account.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Residual Payments</h2>",
            "<p>Residual payments are made from a hosting bank to the ISO who helped a merchant through the<b>onboarding process</b>. These payments are delivered in set time spans that the bank decides upon. These can range from monthly to quarterly.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s important to keep in mind that residual payments are a byproduct of your merchant\u2019s processing volume. A sudden increase, or change in processing from a merchant will result in a very different payout. Many<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/why-use-an-iso-for-credit-card-processing/\"><b>ISOs</b></a>monitor their residuals very closely to make sure any changes to merchant processing volume can be addressed.</p>",
            "<h3>Increasing Your Merchant Account Volume</h3>",
            "<p>During the holidays or other peak times of year you may reach<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-is-a-merchant-account-reserve/\"><b>merchant account thresholds</b></a>. In that case, you should be sure to monitor those merchants who historically need increases or are in an industry that is likely to thrive seasonally.</p>",
            "<p>Increasing merchant account volume is easy and simply requires reaching out to the boarding bank and making a request. They\u2019ll likely ask for new statements and review the most recent processing volume of the merchant. THis will paint a clear picture on the amount the need for their increase.</p>",
            "<h3>Getting Higher Residuals</h3>",
            "<p><b>Higher residuals</b>depend on two major factors, the fees charged to a merchant, and the split you have with the bank you board them with. As an agent, you want to do what\u2019s best for your merchant and provide them with lower fees. This also helps get more merchants processing so you can expand your business. The downside to this is you may receive lower overall profits, but there\u2019s an upside when it comes to working with a bank \u2013 you can<b>negotiate your splits</b>.</p>",
            "<p>Asking for higher splits seems like a normal way to make more money, but when it comes to negotiating, be sure you\u2019re equipped with some leverage. Banks are often risk averse and want to see a long history with diverse merchants and a lot of<b>processing volume</b>. Moreover, if you can move existing merchants over to them, they will offer big bonuses for your business.</p>",

            "<p>What if your business were struggling and you didn\u2019t even know it?</p>",
            "<p>For continuity subscription merchants, this happens quite often. That\u2019s because consumers are always worried about how much they are paying for subscriptions. In fact, consumers spend an average of<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/02/consumers-spend-133-more-monthly-on-subscriptions-than-they-realize.html\">$133 per month</a><em>more</em>on subscriptions than they even realize!</p>",
            "<p>Eventually, these consumers will try to save money by cutting some of their subscriptions. How can you make sure your own business doesn\u2019t start losing customers left and right?</p>",

            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>Unique Challenges Faced By Continuity Subscription Merchants</h2>",
            "<p>Before we get to that, though, we need to address the elephant in the room. Just what are the challenges of the continuity subscription business model that other businesses don\u2019t have to worry about?</p>",
            "<p>First of all, it can be difficult to secure continuity subscription credit card processing. You\u2019ll need to find the right<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/e-commerce-payment-processing-landingpage/\">payment processing partner</a>(more on this later). And since your business model comes with a higher risk of chargebacks, you may have a harder challenge ahead of you.</p>",
            "<p>Along with that, you need to make sure customers stay happy with their subscriptions. That means finding ways to market your business each month without getting too annoying, all while abiding by the requirements of the law .</p>",
            "<p>How can you pull everything off and make running a continuity subscription business a breeze? These tips can help you hit the ground running!</p>",
            "<h3>1. Offer Multiple Payment Methods</h3>",
            "<p>By now, you\u2019ve probably figured out your primary challenge. To both keep your customers and avoid unwanted chargebacks, you need to find ways to make your customers happy.</p>",
            "<p>The old saying is true: you can\u2019t make<em>everybody</em>happy<em>all</em>of the time. However, you can win over most of your customers by offering multiple kinds of payment methods.</p>",
            "<p>The more ways your customers have to pay, the likelier they are to stick with your business. And, of course, the easier it is for<em>them</em>to pay, the easier it is for<em>you</em>to make money.</p>",
            "<h3>2. Consider An Ongoing Email or SMS Campaign</h3>",
            "<p>It can be difficult to find a balancing act to appeal to your customers. For example, it\u2019s important to remind them each month of the value of your business. But if you overwhelm customers with frequent marketing, you may end up driving them away instead.</p>",
            "<p>What\u2019s the solution? We recommend using either an<a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15859-how-to-create-email-drip-campaign.html\">email drip campaign</a>or an SMS campaign. You may even choose to do both, but your ultimate goal should be drip marketing.</p>",
            "<p>With the right software, you can design great email and/or SMS marketing campaigns and send messages out once a week. This is the \u201csweet spot\u201d to keep customers thinking about your business without getting on their nerves!</p>",
            "<h3>3. Use a Clean and Logical Merchant Descriptor</h3>",
            "<p>As we said before, one of your most persistent challenges as a continuity subscription merchant is avoiding consumer chargebacks. And one of the simplest ways to reduce how many chargebacks you get is to make sure your merchant descriptor is clean and direct.</p>",
            "<p>Why is this so important? Some customers who request a chargeback are doing so for a pretty basic reason. Specifically, they aren\u2019t sure what this mysterious charge is on their account!</p>",
            "<p>With a clearer descriptor, you can eliminate such confusion. This won\u2019t eliminate<em>all</em>of the chargeback requests you get, but you might be surprised by how many it takes care of</p>",
            "<h3>4. Make Sure It's Easy for Customers to Cancel</h3>",
            "<p>With a continuity subscription business model, you may be tempted to make it harder for customers to cancel their subscriptions. In reality, it\u2019s very important that you make sure canceling the subscription is very easy.</p>",
            "<p>Why is that? First of all, this is a legal requirement for your business. If you try to circumvent the law, you may face consequences far greater than a chargeback!</p>",
            "<p>If you make it easy to cancel, you can better abide by the law. And if you offer a prorated refund for canceling before the next billing cycle, you can avoid disputes about \u201cservices not provided.\u201d As an added bonus, your ongoing transparency helps build loyalty among your customers!</p>",
            "<h3>5. Always Keep Extensive Records</h3>",
            "<p>If you run any kind of business, it\u2019s important to keep good records. But if you have a continuity subscription business, these records become more important than ever before.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s because you don\u2019t have to take chargebacks laying down. Instead, you can sometimes provide evidence that the chargeback request itself is invalid. This only works, though, if you have the evidence!</p>",
            "<p>What kind of evidence do you need? It\u2019s good to hold onto subscription agreements, cancellation logs, usage logs, and anything else you think may be important. As always, it\u2019s better to have records and not need them than to need records and not have them!</p>",
            "<h3>6. Find a Payment Processing Partner You Can Trust</h3>",
            "<p>Our last tip is simple. Given all the challenges you face as a continuity subscription merchant, it\u2019s very important that you find a payment processing partner you can trust.</p>",
            "<p>As we noted before, you need a processor that gives customers multiple ways to pay. Beyond that, though, you need a partner with great communication skills who will help your business succeed.</p>",
            "<p>In other words, you need a payment processing<em>partner</em>in the truest sense of the word. Between your great products and services and the right partner, the sky is the limit for what you can accomplish!</p>",

Whether you have an eCommerce store or are thinking of adding an eCommerce dimension to your business, it\u2019s important to avoid expensive mistakes.

            "<h2>What Is 3D Secure?</h2>",
            "<p>3D Secure was invented as a way to enhance the level of security for both buyers and sellers. It does this by adding an extra step whenever a shopper buys something online using their credit card.</p>",
            "<p>Are you still asking yourself, \u201cHow does 3D Secure work?\u201d</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s important to know that the 3D in 3D Secure doesn\u2019t refer to those types of movies where things appear to jump out at you. Instead, 3D refers to the three domains involved in the process. These include the credit card issuer, the seller who is going to receive the payment, and the 3DS software itself.</p>",
            "<p>The software facilitates a smooth transaction between the first two domains. By activating the 3DS function, your customers will need to confirm their purchases using a pin code or password.</p>",
            "<p>The intelligent technology behind 3DS for business can determine which transactions need further security to prove that the card owner is, in fact, the card owner. Aside from asking the customer to enter their pin code, the customer\u2019s bank may also generate another pin that\u2019s sent to their phone as a text message. This is a pin that expires and is only used within the moment so that a customer can complete their purchase.</p>",
            "<h2>It Can Stop Cybercriminals</h2>",
            "<p>Did you know that the<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/pittsburgh/news/press-releases/fbi-warning-tis-the-season-for-holiday-scams-1\">citizens of West Virginia</a>lost almost one million dollars due to cybercrime last year? That\u2019s only one state so the losses are even more astronomical across the country. Without proper protection, more and more victims will lose their money over time.</p>",
            "<p>One of the best benefits of 3D Secure involves the reduction of cybercrime. Even if a cybercriminal obtains the credit card information of a customer, they won\u2019t be able to buy anything without the pin code. Let\u2019s imagine that the cybercriminal also managed to get the pin code that the customer uses each time, it won\u2019t matter because they still won\u2019t have their phone number.</p>",
            "<p>This means they\u2019ll miss out on the SMS text from the customer\u2019s bank and still won\u2019t have the ability to finish the transaction.</p>",
            "<h2>Most Major Credit Card Providers Use It</h2>",
            "<p>As a business, you might be questioning the viability of this option. If no more than a handful of credit card companies use this technology, then the vast majority of your customers could be left unprotected. The good news is that almost all of the major credit card companies use this technology.</p>",
            "<p>This makes the setup process that much easier. By investing in it, you\u2019ll also catch up with other businesses that have had it for a long time already.</p>",
            "<h2>It Boosts Customer Trust</h2>",
            "<p>From phishing scams to fake websites, most internet users are cautious about where they spend their time online, let alone their money. It can often be difficult enough to pull customers away from your competitors. This is where the question of trust comes in.</p>",
            "<p>When you invest in 3D Secure, you\u2019re also investing in the trust of your customers. You can let them know that you take security seriously. Once they see for themselves and have a wonderful shopping experience, they\u2019ll continue to shop at your online store instead of your competitor\u2019s store.</p>",
            "<p>You might be wondering if having to put in a pin every time could end up being an annoyance to the customer. Don\u2019t forget that the 3DS platform has the ability to distinguish between transactions that need extra security and those that don\u2019t. If anything suspicious is detected, then that\u2019s when the shopper will have to use the pin.</p>",
            "<h2>Liability Shift</h2>",
            "<p>Many online purchases are considered high-risk because your business can end up being responsible for chargebacks, fraudulent transactions, and more. Instead of dealing with this high risk on a regular basis, 3D Secure gives you the option of shifting liability.</p>",
            "<p>That way, the responsibility will fall on the credit card company rather than your business anytime a cardholder disputes a charge. This can end up saving you a significant amount of money in the long run. Looking at it that way, the investment of 3DS pays for itself.</p>",
            "<p>Even during situations where the 3DS platform was down or the credit card didn\u2019t go through the required process, your business can still enjoy a liability shift.</p>",
            "<p>The times in which liability shift doesn\u2019t occur are few and far between. They often depend on a certain set of extenuating circumstances, such as a high preponderance of fraud that occurs on your eCommerce site, in particular. To learn more details, it\u2019s worth speaking with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\">a 3D Secure expert</a>who can answer your questions in full.</p>",

            "<h3>Security Measures</h3>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also important to know the security measures that the credit card processor will take as well. Be sure that your customers\u2019 credit card information will be safe and that it won\u2019t be lost or stolen.</p>",

Ideally, look for a credit card payment processor that provides 24/7 support. Ensure that the company allows you to get in direct touch with a real person to get solutions for your problems.</p>",
            "<p>Consider reading some online reviews before choosing a credit card processor to find out how they tend to treat their clients.

Imagine that you are an e-commerce business that cannot accept credit card payments. That means that you could lose out on over half of your sales.</p>",
            "<p>Even if you have a payment processor, this could be a reality for your merchant account if you encounter frozen funds. A frozen account can happen anytime a payment processor suspects fraudulent activities.</p>",
            "<p>Essentially, frozen funds can be detrimental to your business. Unfortunately, this can happen anytime without warning.</p>",
            "<p>That doesn\u2019t mean there are no solutions to fix such a dilemma. Keep reading to learn about frozen funds and what to do next should it happen to your merchant account.</p>",

            "<h2>Frozen Account Versus an Account on Hold</h2>",
            "<p>An account on hold is not the same as a frozen account. When a payment processor puts a hold on a merchant account, it usually happens for certain transactions. You have access to some funds and a hold will not stop all transactions.</p>",
            "<p>A payment processor could put a hold on a transaction you have because it needs a minimum reserve to cover possible costs like fraudulent transactions and chargebacks. You can continue to<a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/how-to-accept-credit-card-payments\" target=\"_blank\">process customer payments</a>while the payment processor keeps the funds on hold indefinitely. This is a deposit, of sorts, that you can recoup if you close your account.</p>",
            "<p>If you have a frozen account, however, all your activity will halt. That is because the payment processor needs to hold the funds so they can investigate agreement violations or suspected fraud.</p>",
            "<p>A merchant cannot process any transactions during an account freeze. Also, pending transactions cannot transfer to their bank account either. The most unfortunate part of a frozen account is that a merchant cannot accept cards until an investigation is complete and proves transactions to be legitimate.</p>",
            "<h2>How Long Does a Frozen Account Last?</h2>",
            "<p>Many payment processors will state in their contracts the duration of freezes. Some payment processors can freeze accounts for up to 120 days while they investigate fraudulent activities. Although, it does not mean it will take that long</p>",
            "<p>.</p>",
            "<p>It is important to work with the payment processor to resolve the issue to<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/best-merchant-account-for-retail/\" target=\"_blank\">lift the freeze sooner</a>. In fact, by working with the payment processor, you could unfreeze your account within a week.</p>",
            "<p>While you want to cooperate, you also need to consider how you can accept payments during this time. Also, you want to learn why this happened to your account so that you can prevent it from happening again in the future.</p>",
            "<h2>What Now?</h2>",
            "<p>When you encounter a frozen account, talk with your processor, and find out what caused it. Ask what you can do so that the issue resolves quickly. While the payment processor may not explain everything they are investigating, they can tell you the reason for the freeze.</p>",
            "<p>Further, the payment processor should be able to tell you how you can assist with their investigation. If they need documentation or information for a specific transaction, you will want to provide it as fast as you can and with transparency. You can resolve the issue quickly when you offer details quickly.</p>",
            "<h2>How to Continue Accepting Payments</h2>",
            "<p>While your merchant account is under review, you do not want to stop conducting business. In the meantime, you will need to accept other payment methods.</p>",
            "<p>For in-person transactions, you can request cash payments. Just make sure you let the customer know upfront they need cash.</p>",
            "<p>You can accept checks if you know and trust the customer. This could be an excellent alternative to credit cards. However, this does not mean you want to accept checks from everyone, as a bad check would bounce, and this will not help your situation.</p>",
            "<p>There are peer-to-peer apps you can accept, like Zelle, PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App. Customers can send you money with these apps directly, and it will deposit in your app account.</p>",
            "<p>For a backup to credit card payments, this is an excellent alternative. However, keep in mind that these apps are also subject to freezes if they see fraudulent activities.</p>",
            "<h2>A Backup Payment Processor</h2>",
            "<p>If you must accept credit cards, consider having a payment processor who is your backup. This doesn\u2019t mean you should rush into a new contract.</p>",

            "<p>After speaking with the payment processor and assisting with the investigation, you will need to prioritize your expenses that are business-critical. You want to mitigate damage to your business finances.</p>",
            "<p>Consider how you will pay employees, pause subscriptions you cannot afford, and pay for overhead that you cannot pause, such as rent. You will need to disable this option of payment on your eCommerce website and let customers know about the payment processing changes.</p>",

            "<h2>Collecting Credit Card Payments in Person</h2>",
            "<p>First, collecting credit card payments in person has a unique process from transacting online payments. For in-person, you would need a point-of-sale system or a card reader. This way, customers can tap, swipe, or dip their cards.</p>",
            "<p>A POS (point-of-sale) system combines card reader software with the hardware functionality of a cash register. The software allows you to not only ring up customers and take orders but track inventory, too. You can monitor financial trends.</p>",
            "<h2>Online Payments</h2>",
            "<p>For an eCommerce setup, or to take an order over the phone, you will need a payment gateway.</p>",

            "<h2>Payment Processing Fees</h2>",
            "<p>When you accept credit card payments, you will need to pay a fee for them. Often, the payment processing fee is a fixed amount plus a percentage of the sale price.</p>",
            "<p>Because an online business has a greater risk of fraudulent activities, fees for online payments are usually greater. However, it all depends on your plan, the type of card your customer uses, and many other factors.</p>",
            "<h2>How Do Credit Card Payments Work?</h2>",
            "<p>You need a payment processor to accept credit card payments. A credit card payment will not directly go from the customer\u2019s bank account directly to your bank account. Rather, there is a chain reaction involving multiple financial institutions.</p>",
            "<p>First, the online payment gateway, or card reader for in-person purchases, will capture the details of the credit card. Then, the payment processor has the job of transmitting data to the network of the associated card, like Visa or MasterCard.</p>",
            "<h2>Routing the Payment Request</h2>",
            "<p>While this occurs, the payment processor also requests details from the network of the card. This then routes the payment request to the issuer of the card, like Bank of America or Chase.</p>",
            "<p>The issuer evaluates the payment request. They will approve or deny the payment. If you get approval, the transaction is complete.</p>",
            "<p>Upon approval, the payment processor will give the issuing bank instructions to send the funds to your merchant account. After a couple of business days, the merchant can get<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/next-day-funding-merchant-account/\" target=\"_blank\">access to the online payment</a>funds, minus the payment processing fees.</p>",
            "<p>While the process seems complex, waiting for approval should take a matter of seconds for completion.</p>",
            "<h2>Choosing a Merchant Account Provider</h2>",
            "<p>The merchant account is where funds go after a transaction is complete. Often, in one to two business days, the money can transfer to a business account.</p>",
            "<p>If you use an excellent payment service provider, they will provide you with a merchant account, which will transfer money to your individual company\u2019s bank account.</p>",
            "<p>Payment service providers are easy to work with. For a small business, it is a cost-effective way to set up a merchant account and they can set it up quickly.</p>",

            "<h3>High Risk Industries For Echecks</h3>",
            "<p>Some industries call for different types of payments such as echeck payment processing .

            "<h3>Echeck vs Credit Card Processing</h3>",
            "<p>One of the biggest differences with echecks is the<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-get-lower-payment-processing-rates/\"><b>lower payment processing fees</b></a>. Credit card companies like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express charge a fee for all companies who accept their cards, but going directly to someone\u2019s bank account avoids this charge.</p>",

            "<p>Echecks and ACH payments work hand-in-hand, however ACH allows you the ability to bill on a recurring basis.

            "<h2>Chargeback Fraud</h2>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">Chargeback fraud</a>is kind of like a less friendly version of friendly fraud. While the \u201cfraud\u201d in friendly fraud is unintentional, chargeback fraud involves a cardholder knowingly and<a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/disputing-credit-card-charges\">deliberately disputing a charge</a>and demanding a refund despite knowing that he or she did in fact approve the purchase and actually received the relevant goods and/or services.</p>",
            "<p>There are a variety of reasons that people commit chargeback fraud, the most common of which is \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d missing the deadline for returns and simply wanting to avoid paying the bill.</p>",
            "<h2>Preventing Chargeback Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>Because chargeback fraud and friendly fraud have a similar pattern, with the former being intentional while the latter is generally unintentional, the things that you can do to prevent them are also the same in some ways. You should consider implementing the following.</p>",
            "<h4>Get Started Today!</h4>",
            "<h3>Skilled and reliable customer service</h3>",
            "<p>If your customer service staff is skilled and experienced, they will more often than not be able to tell when something isn\u2019t quite right with a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-fight-large-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">dispute</a>. Politely and professionally questioning the customer about the problematic details alone could discourage the person from continuing with the scam. At the very least, a customer service team that can be politely skeptical when necessary could give you the ability to start investigating as early as possible. The time and effort spent training the team well is likely to provide a variety of benefits, including saving you money and preventing bothersome legal action.</p>",
            "<h3>Effective and reasonable return policy</h3>",
            "<p>Sometimes cardholders don\u2019t understand the deadline for returns or simply forget about it, but still attempt to get a refund by initiating a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">chargeback</a>. This differs from asking for an exception to be made. Chargeback fraud involves a deliberate attempt to deceive the merchant, etc. Having a clear, easy-to-understand return/refund policy will help you in two ways. First, honest customers will be less likely to forget about a return deadline. Second, it makes it harder for dishonest customers to get around the policy. Be sure to include enough flexibility that legitimate extenuating circumstances can be taken into consideration. That willingness to listen to the customer and go a little above and beyond to help her often results in a higher degree of customer loyalty and more word-of-mouth advertising for your business.</p>",
            "<h3>Clear and attentive communication</h3>",
            "<p>As is the case with<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/types-of-credit-card-fraud-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">friendly fraud</a>, consistent and clear communication that isn\u2019t so frequent that it becomes annoying will do much to deter chargeback fraud. The frequent contact itself often discourages scammers from continuing their attempts, but it also gives you more leverage against specious disputes. Similar to friendly fraud, this contact can be as simple as sending an order confirmation, a shipping notification, and a follow-up message after the customer has received the items. E-mail communication can include easily seen links to your return/refund policy. Regular reminders for recurring payments and reasonably hassle-free ways to cancel orders can also be helpful.</p>",
            "<h3>Delivery tracking and confirmation</h3>",
            "<p>One of the most common approaches taken by scammers attempting to defraud a merchant is simply to claim that the product was never received. This is where delivery tracking and confirmation can make a huge difference. The technology for tracking and confirmation continues to evolve, and its accuracy is improving. It may not be possible to get a signature in every case, but many delivery companies now photograph the package at the delivery point, often using an angle from which the location can be identified (e.g., showing the front door of the house). If you have solid evidence that the product was delivered correctly, chances are that the fraudster will back off.</p>",
            "<h2>True Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>The most malicious and ill-intended type of credit card fraud is referred to as \u201ctrue fraud.\u201d True fraud involves the use of a lost or stolen credit card to make a purchase that was not authorized by the cardholder. One way this differs from the other types of credit card fraud is that it is not the cardholder committing the fraud, but instead a third party. The cardholder files a dispute and initiates a chargeback because he or she did not actually make the purchase or authorize the use of the card.</p>",
            "<p>In addition to lost or stolen cards, the fraudster may use counterfeit cards, often with a duplicated magnetic strip. Using the credit card information (account number, PIN, card verification codes, etc.) without actually having the physical card (a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/ultimate-guide-to-credit-card-processing/\" target=\"_blank\">card-not-present transaction</a>) also falls under this category in certain aspects. A fake card is sometimes used. A fake card differs from a counterfeit card in that, while the counterfeit card is created to actually function as a credit card, a fake (or disabled) card can be used to get the merchant to enter the information manually. This may create enough of a delay in the transaction being denied that the fraudster will be gone, merchandise in hand.</p>",
            "<h2>Preventing True Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>The loss and damage from true fraud can be enormous, particularly if it is combined with chargeback fraud. In such cases, the merchant loses the price of the merchandise twice, once when it is fraudulently acquired to begin with, then again when a fraudulent chargeback is initiated. Be sure that you and all of your employees understand the seriousness of the risk and consistently implement measures to combat credit card fraud. The following are some of the common ways to prevent or discourage true fraud.</p>",
            "<h3>No manual payments</h3>",
            "<p>Some fake or doctored credit cards are very skillfully and accurately created, making it difficult to tell the difference between them and real cards. If you have a basic policy of not entering card information manually, you can eliminate this risk completely. Naturally, you are still able to make exceptions for customers that you know and trust.</p>",
            "<h3>Chip readers</h3>",
            "<p>Using a chip reader takes away the ability of fraudsters to create counterfeit cards by tampering with the magnetic strip. The security functions of the chips continue to be improved, and their usefulness against fraud is expected to increase.</p>",
            "<h3>Cybersecurity Measures</h3>",
            "<p>Another area of technology that continues to advance is technology to enhance the security of online transactions. A payment process that does not require the physical card to be present can be highly vulnerable to various types of fraud and tampering. Fortunately, technology is now available to do things such as denying fraudulent transactions before they are processed. It is anticipated that this technology will continue to be improved as well.</p>",
            "<h3>Security codes</h3>",
            "<p>One of the measures that could be seen as a subset of the above is the use of security codes for card-not-present transactions, whether online, over the telephone, or on a mobile app. Requiring a security code is one way to confirm that the individual making the purchase is in possession of the card. There are still ways to get around this, of course, but like the other technological measures against fraud, improvements are expected to continue.</p>",
            "<h2>Paying Attention Is The First Step In Protecting Your Business</h2>",
            "<p>Although there is a growing pool of effective technology that you can (and should) use to protect your business from credit card fraud, the best way to protect yourself is to pay attention and do your due diligence. As has been mentioned, one of the reasons that businesses may be given the label \u201chigh-risk business\u201d is the higher frequency of fraud in the industry. It can, of course, be a factor in having your request to open a merchant account denied by a bank. A record of being the victim of fraud can also result in the bank terminating your payment processing agreement and canceling your account.</p>",
            "<p>For those and other reasons, operators of high-risk businesses need to give particular care and be diligent in their measures against credit card fraud. If you are using a high-risk payment processor, talk to them about things you can do to prevent fraud, and how their measures and your company\u2019s measures against fraud can be used together to give you the best protection possible.</p>"

            "<p>Recent statistics show that eCommerce website retailers<a href=\"https://financesonline.com/ecommerce-fraud-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">experience 206,000 web attacks</a>per month on average. Cyberattacks are troublesome for you, the merchant, and they are troublesome for your customers, too.</p>",
            "<p>In fact, if customers do not feel secure making an online payment with your business, you risk losing a lot of business. Not to worry, though, because the best payment gateway can help you ensure payment security. Your customers will thank you, and with more business!</p>",
            "<p>How can a payment gateway increase security for your eCommerce website? They help in more ways than one! Keeping reading for the details.</p>",
            "<h2>Speak With An Expert Today!</h2>",
            "<h2>What Is a Payment Gateway?</h2>",
            "<p>It\u2019s the technology that a merchant will use so they can accept credit or debit card purchases from their customers. A payment gateway can be for online payments, but merchants also use them in brick-and-mortar retail stores with a physical reading device.</p>",
            "<h2>Security Features of a Payment Gateway</h2>",
            "<p>Some consumers dislike making online payments because they are concerned about security. That is why, for a small business to be successful in launching an eCommerce website, it must also implement the best payment gateway offering top-notch security.</p>",
            "<p>Customers want to know that you are offering a mode of payment that will protect their personal data from cyberattacks by mitigating vulnerabilities. When working with a payment gateway, you must partner with one that has these security features.</p>",
            "<h2>PCI Compliance</h2>",
            "<p>You should not work with a payment gateway unless it offers<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/pci-non-compliance-fee/\" target=\"_blank\">PCI-compliant data protection</a>. That is because, otherwise, you are leaving yourself vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, attackers, and thieves.</p>",
            "<p>The PCI DSS is a set of guidelines that helps merchants like you provide your customers with secure payment solutions.</p>",
            "<h2>Data Encryption</h2>",
            "<p>A common practice for a payment gateway,<a href=\"https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-data-encryption\" target=\"_blank\">data encryption</a>is another layer of protection that prevents hackers from stealing customer data. The best payment gateway will mask their data. They do this by creating their own code.</p>",
            "<p>The payment gateway will turn your customer\u2019s information into a format that needs decryption, and you can read it privately. Only those who need to see it will see it.</p>",
            "<h2>Tokenization</h2>",
            "<p>This is not like the mathematical formula in encryption. Instead, it is a method that is random for securing data. Here, the actual numbers for the credit card payment are replaced with characters at random.</p>",
            "<p>This is a code or \u201ctoken.\u201d You cannot trace it to a cardholder.</p>",
            "<p>If a cybercriminal is successful in a data breach, they still cannot decode the characters and, therefore cannot piece together real card numbers. A \u201ctoken vault,\u201d or a database, stores both the code and the actual information.</p>",
            "<h2>Hashing</h2>",
            "<p>This is a one-way process. With hashing, an algorithm will transform raw data into a line of alphanumeric characters, which makes reading it impossible. These characters are the value, or \u201chash code.\u201d With hashing, you cannot reverse this process.</p>",
            "<h2>What You Can Do When Collecting Online Payments</h2>",
            "<p>While the payment gateway will offer protection, there are security measures you can take as well as the merchant. First, require that your customers practice using strong passwords with their accounts.</p>",
            "<p>Cybercriminals are experts at cracking security passwords with an easy-to-guess combination of names and birthdays. When customers use strong passwords, this goes a long way in adding another important layer to maintain security.</p>",
            "<p>Customers may not enjoy having to choose a strong password because they get fatigued from creating passwords for all their accounts. Then, they must remember which is which. That is why it is important to offer an easy to access their account if they forget with a \u201cforgot my password\u201d button.</p>",
            "<h2>Request the CVV</h2>",
            "<p>The CVV code is the Card Verification Value, often found on the back side of a physical credit card. This is one way you can verify card-not-present online payments. You can request the CVV over the phone or online.</p>",
            "<p>This information is only available with the physical card, so merchants can better validate transactions from cards that are not stolen.</p>",
            "<h2>Use SCA: Strong Customer Authentication</h2>",
            "<p>SCA reduces fraud. You can increase online payment security with SCA because you are asking for two or more elements during the authentication process. For instance, you can ask for:</p>",
            "<p>When protecting your customers and assuring efficient processing of online payments, there is a significant benefit to adding layers of security.</p>",
            "<h2>Monitor Fraud Continuously</h2>",
            "<p>The best payment gateway can play an integral role in this. They must have a way to detect and manage fraud with a built-in fraud monitoring solution. This identifies orders where there is a tremendous<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-chargebacks-and-friendly-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">risk of fraudulent activities</a>.</p>",
            "<p>As the business, however, you can set the rules which revolve around your risk tolerance and are based on your situation or industry.

            "<h1>Getting a Merchant Account for a High-Risk Business</h1>",
            "<p>Many things are needed to enable businesses to gain and retain customers. Products and services that customers want, for example, as well as a high level of quality, attentive follow-up after-sales, reliability, reasonable prices, and such. One of the most important elements\u2014one that is often overlooked\u2014is the implementation of measures to make it easy for customers to pay. One way to do this is to offer as many ways to pay as possible. Preferences for payment methods (e.g., debit cards/cash vs. credit cards) differ from person to person and change over time as new technology is introduced or circumstances otherwise change. It may also differ by industry or location. Regardless, the ability to accept credit card payments (whether in person or online) is a must for most businesses today. For<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">online payments</a>, in particular, it\u2019s necessary to provide a gateway to merchant accounts for high-risk businesses.</p>",
            "<h2>Merchant Accounts</h2>",
            "<p>One of the main steps in creating a business, whether large or small, is deciding what forms of payment you will accept and what specific process will be used for payments. Ordinarily, you would open a merchant account for your business. What is a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/ultimate-guide-to-credit-card-processing/\" target=\"_blank\">merchant account</a>? It is a type of bank account that enables businesses to accept credit and debit card payments. This applies whether payments are made with the physical card in person, over the telephone, or online.</p>",
            "<p>A card transaction involves three parties: the cardholder (usually the customer), the business or merchant, and the payment processor. Card transactions usually occur quickly, especially as Internet connection speeds continue to increase. Data is transmitted between the three parties at high speed. This is a benefit to both the customer and the business. For example, customers are able to complete purchases quickly, so they are able to begin using the purchased products or services quickly. Businesses are able to receive payments quickly, with payments usually going directly into the business\u2019 bank account. Businesses are also able to avoid the risk of having cash in a physical store, making it susceptible to being lost, stolen, or miscounted.</p>",
            "<h3>Areas of High-Risk Business</h3>",
            "<p>Merchants usually go to a traditional bank to apply for a business account. Sometimes, the bank will deny the application. This most often occurs in the case of high-risk businesses. There are two general categories of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/whats-considered-a-high-risk-merchant/\" target=\"_blank\">high-risk businesses</a>. One is the \u201cRed Zone,\u201d which refers to businesses that are considered risky independently of their business history. Some of the factors that can put a business in the \u201cRed Zone\u201d are being in an industry that has a high risk of<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-to-fight-large-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">chargebacks</a>, dealing only with services or intangible products, dealing in<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-high-volume/\" target=\"_blank\">high-volume sales</a>, failing to comply with industry safety/security standards and regulations, and operating \u201cadult-oriented\u201d services (e.g., pornography, gambling, tobacco, weapons, alcohol).</p>",
            "<p>The other is the \u201cGrey Zone,\u201d which refers to businesses that are considered risky because of their actual business history. Factors that can put a business in the \u201cGrey Zone\u201d include having a bad business credit score or no score at all, having a high chargeback rate, being an international merchant, and accepting/dealing with foreign currency.</p>",
            "<p>Some merchants who apply for a merchant account at a traditional bank are surprised to find out that they are considered to be \u201chigh-risk.\u201d For example,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-tech-support-merchant-account/\" target=\"_blank\">online technical support</a>is considered to be high-risk because of the prevalence of fraud in the industry. Traditional banks are reluctant to get involved with such risks, which are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the fact that your business is completely honest and trustworthy is unlikely to counteract the negative perception of the industry.</p>",
            "<h2>High-Risk Merchant Accounts</h2>",
            "<p>Fortunately, being considered high-risk does not necessarily mean that the business has less potential for success or that it\u2019s impossible for the business to be stable and secure. It also does not mean that the business cannot open a merchant account merely because it cannot open one in a traditional bank. a variety of companies offer payment processing for high-risk businesses. Some payment processors even<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">specialize in high-risk businesses</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Selecting the<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/zen-payments-provides-high-risk-143000456.html\">right payment processor</a>for your high-risk merchant account is an important decision. Some of the things you should look for in a payment processor are listed below.</p>",
            "<h3>Screening Potential Payment Processors</h3>",
            "<p>When screening potential payment processors, be sure to ask questions and get clarification of anything you don\u2019t understand. Pay attention to gaining a mutual understanding of expectations, requirements, and the details of services so that it can be an effective<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/partner-program/\">partnership</a>. If possible, find a payment processor that specializes in high-risk businesses. It is also important to find a payment processor that has a wide range of technological tools, a proven record of compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards, and a secure payment system and gateway.</p>",
            "<p>Utilizing a good payment processor will enable you to focus on building your business since the payment processor will be handling security. Your customers will have a better experience making payments, and, ultimately, you should be able to save money and focus on increasing revenue.</p>"

With almost $10 billion in costs, it\u2019s not hard to see how this issue can cause a business to close its virtual doors if nothing is done to stop it. The good news is that you can use RDR for chargebacks and get the protection you need.</p>",

            "<h2>What Is Rapid Dispute Resolution?</h2>",
            "<p>Rapid Dispute Resolution is modern software that works wonders within the field of eCommerce. Instead of a manual process for each transaction, Rapid Dispute Resolution adds an element of automation. This can allow you to avoid getting into a traditional dispute and solve the issue during a pre-dispute stage, preventing any chargebacks.</p>",
            "<p>There are several common reasons customers open a dispute in the hopes of a chargeback. One of the most common reasons is the claim that the services or products they paid for weren\u2019t received. Yet another reason is due to the products either not being as described or being defective in some way.</p>",
            "<p>As mentioned above, credit card fraud is rampant, so that\u2019s another reason customers may want a chargeback. Another type of fraud is known as \u201c<a href=\"https://studyfinds.org/friendly-fraud-returning-worn-clothes-crime/\">friendly fraud</a>,\u201d and it refers to a customer who opens a dispute to receive a chargeback even though they received the goods and services that they paid for.</p>",
            "<p>Are you still asking yourself, \u201cHow does Rapid Dispute Resolution work?\u201d</p>",
            "<p>RDR works based on various algorithmic rules that you can set up ahead of time. No two businesses are the exact same, so you\u2019ll be glad to know that you can configure your RDR solution to fit your specific needs to a T. This can allow you to get the absolute most from your investment.</p>",

            "<p>Now that you can answer the question, \u201cWhat is RDR,\u201d you might be wondering why it\u2019s worth the investment in the first place. Managing disputes on a manual level can cost you managerial fees.</p>",
            "<p>A few disputes once in a while might not weigh down an employee\u2019s schedule, but you have to think in the long term. If you plan on growing your business and expanding your brand, then you\u2019ll need to ensure that every facet of your operations has the ability to scale.</p>",
            "<p>At a bigger level, your employees can end up overwhelmed by hundreds of disputes a week if not more than that. Aside from managerial fees, there\u2019s also a large number of chargebacks you can avoid in the first place. If a chargeback isn\u2019t legitimate, then it\u2019s your responsibility to prevent it and avoid having to pay a friendly-fraud criminal.</p>",
            "<p>Looking at it this way, RDR pays for itself in the long run because of the vast amount of savings your business will enjoy.</p>",
            "<h2>It Reduces the Time Involved</h2>",
            "<p>One of the greatest benefits of RDR is the amount of time it can save you with each dispute. Since RDR is automatic, it can handle hundreds of disputes or more without you having to lift a finger. That way, you can focus on the specific disputes that require a real person\u2019s attention.</p>",
            "<p>Not only does this save your business time that can be spent elsewhere but it\u2019ll also save your customer\u2019s time. A single dispute can end up taking a week, a month, or even longer, depending on the circumstances.</p>",
            "<p>Implementing RDR is often more simple than some people think. Once you\u2019ve signed up for it using an enrollment form and set your specific parameters, you can expect it to work like a charm right away. If you\u2019re not sure what parameters would work best with your business, then the provider can help by assessing your business type and making suggestions.</p>",
            "<p>You can change the parameters at any time so don\u2019t worry about them being locked in the first time.</p>",
            "<h2>It Can Keep Customers Happy</h2>",
            "<p>Sometimes a customer will buy something that didn\u2019t fit their needs or satisfy them in some way.

By ensuring that the customer gets their money as fast as possible, you can leave them with a positive impression.</p>",

There\u2019s no denying that return customers are the best kind, but they only return if they\u2019ve had a positive experience. Whether there was an issue with the product itself or there was an error in the bill, you shouldn\u2019t force your customers to wait longer than necessary.</p>",

            "<p>For example, the cardholder is the person who has a credit card or debit card. They\u2019re normally involved in the authorization or settlement stage. The cardholder will get the card from the bank and then use it to pay for services or products.</p>",

            "<p>There are also two types of banks that you\u2019re going to work with: your acquiring or issuing bank. The acquiring bank is your business\u2019s bank, and the issuing bank is the cardholder\u2019s bank.</p>",
            "<p>An acquiring bank will need to be a member of the association of the card. For example, if they are giving out a Visa card, then they have to be a member of the Visa association. These banks will work with merchants to maintain their accounts and let them accept card payments.</p>",
            "<p>These banks will sometimes provide software and equipment, but sometimes you\u2019ll need to get it from a different company and connect it to your merchant\u2019s bank.</p>",

            "<h2>Authorization</h2>",
            "<p>This is the first stage of the transaction, and the cardholder will give their card information to the merchant. They might enter their card number into the processing system, or swipe and insert their card.</p>",
            "<p>Once they do that, the merchant will send a request for payment authorization. The payment processor then sends the request to the card association, and the association sends it to the issuing bank. The issuing bank will then approve or deny the request and send the message to the card association.</p>",
            "<p>Then, the card association will send the payment to your payment processor, and then it gets sent to your business. If it\u2019s denied, then you will have to reach out to the bank of the cardholder.</p>",
            "<h3>Authentication</h3>",
            "<p>The authentication stage will happen once the cardholder makes the transaction. This is when the bank makes sure that the transaction is actually valid.</p>",
            "<p>The issuing bank will validate all of the information and send an approval to the merchant bank or the card association. The issuing bank will then put a hold on that amount on the cardholder\u2019s account.</p>",
            "<p>However, the business should be able to see the transaction on the terminal at the end of the day so that they can process it.</p>",
            "<h2>Settlement</h2>",
            "<p>When the payment is settled, this is when the merchant will actually get the money. You\u2019ll get batched payments for the authorized funds.</p>",
            "<p>The payment processor will have to send this batch to the card association, and then the card association will send this information to the issuing bank.</p>",
            "<p>Then, the issuing bank will charge the account of the cardholder for the authorized payment. The issuing bank will then subtract any fees before they send the money over to the merchant account.</p>",

            "<p>Therefore, banks often hesitate to do business with your average high ticket coach for the same reason they hesitate to do business with any high ticket account. In the bank\u2019s eyes, these are all high-risk merchants that may end up causing the bank financial woes instead of making them money.</p>",

            "<h2>High Ticket Items and Chargebacks</h2>",
            "<p>When customers don\u2019t receive their items or aren\u2019t satisfied with the product, they can dispute the payment. And if their dispute is successful, it results<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargeback.asp\">in a chargeback</a>. This results in the customer getting the money back, effectively retrieving their funds from the bank.</p>",
            "<p>As you might imagine, banks don\u2019t like chargebacks because the process costs them time and money. And the expensive nature of high-ticket coaching programs and other high-ticket items makes chargebacks on these items much likelier.</p>",

            "<p>First, a high-risk merchant account helps you fight chargebacks. For one thing, you\u2019ll find out about disputes early enough to issue a standard refund before it turns into a chargeback. And when customers do proceed with the chargeback process, a good payment processor can help you fight back and win.</p>",
            "<p>The right processor also provides multi-channel payment processing, fast approvals, and reliable fraud prevention. In short, this is about more than just taking payments. It\u2019s about making your business safer and more reliable than ever before!</p>",
            "<h2>The Best Ways to Manage Your High Ticket Coaching Account</h2>",

            "<p>For example, invest in electronic ID verification. It\u2019s fast, unobtrusive, and prevents<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/true-fraud/\">fraud</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Ask for digital signatures on sales. This also helps prevent fraud. As a bonus, it makes it easier for you to respond to a chargeback.</p>",
            "<p>Consider being selective about where you do business. Selling all around the world sounds great, but online fraud is more prevalent in some countries than in others. Blocking sales to high-risk countries reduces your own online sales risks.</p>",
            "<p>Be sure to review all fraud-fighting tools and techniques at your disposal. Staying on top of this and making changes where necessary can help you deal with any fraud you can\u2019t prevent.</p>",

            "<p>Second, investigate how the company prevents fraud and fights against chargebacks. This is arguably the biggest benefit of having a high-risk account. Therefore, you want to get your money\u2019s worth.</p>",
            "<p>Third, make sure you understand the price structure and fees of the processor. These fees can really add up across many transactions. Make sure you are satisfied with the rates before you sign anything!</p>",

            "<p>Well, the answer is yes. And no.</p>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s take a look at what it is that we\u2019re asking.</p>",
            "<p>A merchant account is really just<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-to-do-if-your-merchant-account-is-closed-part-1/\">a line of credit</a>that makes it possible for your business to accept payments by credit card. That means that when you apply for a merchant account for your business, it\u2019s a lot like you\u2019re applying for a credit card. Your credit score is one factor that\u2019s considered, but not the only one. A variety of things are taken into consideration when a credit card issuer decides whether or not giving you a credit card is a good idea.</p>",
            "<p>When you apply for a merchant account, your personal creditworthiness is part of the equation, but not as big of a part as it would be in an application for a credit card or a loan. It\u2019s as if a line of credit were being extended to a combination of you<em>and</em>your business. The bank, etc., looks at things about you, things about the industry, and things about the business itself. So, your personal credit matters, but how much it matters can vary.</p>",
            "<h3>When it Matters, Why Does it Matter?</h3>",
            "<p>That means that the real question here is, \u201cWhen my personal credit<em>does</em>matter in my application for a merchant account, why does it matter, and more importantly, what can I do about it?\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Understanding how credit card payments are processed can help clarify why your personal creditworthiness matters when you apply for a merchant account. First, after a credit card transaction is initiated, the payment amount is placed in the merchant\u2019s bank account. The amount is recorded in the customer\u2019s account as a debt. If the customer later initiates a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\">chargeback</a>, the bank has to take that amount out of the merchant\u2019s account and subtract the amount from the customer\u2019s debt balance.</p>",
            "<p>Although it does<a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/finance/credit-card-processing-fees-chargebacks\">cost</a>both the merchant and the bank a certain amount of time and money, every business that accepts credit card payments has to deal with chargebacks to one degree or another. The problem, however, is that the merchant may not have enough money in its bank account to complete the refund. The risk of this increases the longer it has been since the credit card transaction was made.</p>",
            "<p>If that happens, the bank has to use its own funds to reimburse the customer. It then must try to collect that amount from the merchant. If the merchant doesn\u2019t have enough money in the bank to reimburse the customer in the first place, the bank is likely to have a difficult time recovering the amount.</p>",
            "<p>The credit history, etc., of the person operating and making decisions for the business can be a good indicator of what can be expected from the business. If the bank believes that your credit history, etc., suggests that it is unlikely that the bank would be able to recover its funds, it is also unlikely that the bank will agree to take on that risk.</p>",
            "<h2>Three Credit Problems That Doom Your Application</h2>",
            "<p>Three of the main things related to personal credit that will most likely make a traditional bank unwilling to provide your business with a merchant account are:</p>",
            "<p><em>Insufficient or no credit history</em></p>",
            "<p>The bank might not expect you to have a lot of credit history, but it needs something to judge your creditworthiness, so it will expect you to have some. The only thing that you can do about this is to establish a credit history. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not something that you can do immediately, so it will take a certain amount of time.</p>",
            "<p><em>Accounts, etc., in collections</em></p>",
            "<p>Having debt that has been given to a collection agency will probably prevent you from getting a merchant account at a traditional bank. The good news is that if you pay off the debt it will eventually disappear from your credit report and no longer prevent you from getting a merchant account. The bad news is that it takes time.</p>",
            "<p><em>Bankruptcy</em></p>",
            "<p>Being in bankruptcy currently will probably be enough for a traditional bank to deny your application for a merchant account. Once you have discharged the bankruptcy and reestablished your credit, you should be able to get your application approved, but in this case as well, it takes time.</p>",
            "<h3>Another Option</h3>",
            "<p>So, does personal credit matter when opening a merchant account? What can you do if waiting until you build up a substantial credit history, pay back debt that\u2019s gone to collections, or have bankruptcy discharged is not an acceptable option? If you are operating a high-risk business to begin with, and have bad credit on top of it, are you simply out of luck?</p>",
            "<p>Fortunately, you do have another option that can help you get your business up and running. A high-risk payment processor may be exactly what you need. A high-risk payment processor such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/\">Zen Payments</a>specializes in payment processing for high-risk industries, so it knows those industries better than a traditional banker would.</p>",

If your company does business online, it needs to accept cards to ensure it\u2019s paid for its services in a timely fashion. Your company typically needs a merchant account to accept credit cards, a line of credit that gives you access to the funds your payment processor receives from transactions.</p>",

            "<p>Having your merchant account terminated by your payment processor can disrupt your business. You can\u2019t accept card payments without a merchant account, meaning it can be difficult to operate an online business without one.

            "<h2>Reach out to the Payment Processor</h2>",

            "<p>Even if the payment processor won\u2019t agree to reinstate your account, ask it to provide you with a written statement explaining the termination. Also, verify that your information has been put on the Member Alert to Control High-Risk Merchants (MATCH) list. If a payment processor terminates your merchant account, it\u2019s required to put your business on the MATCH list. Being on the list changes the process you go through when opening a new merchant account.</p>",
            "<h2>Save Your Statements</h2>",
            "<p>If you haven\u2019t done so previously, it\u2019s a good idea to log into your account portal and download your account statements for at least the past six months.

If you\u2019re in a highly regulated industry, such as CBD, firearms or vaping, violating local and federal laws can put you at risk. To keep your merchant account from getting shut down, look for a payment processor that knows the ins and outs of your industry.</p>",
            "<p>Communication is the key to avoiding account shutdown. When you first sign up for your merchant account, provide the payment processor with an estimate of your monthly transaction volume and the average value of each transaction. If you anticipate hundreds of sales worth $500 or more per month, the processor needs to know that. If you tell the payment processor your sales average will be under $50, then you have a series of $500 or higher transactions, alarm bells will go off for the payment processor.</p>",
            "<p>When you open a new merchant account, a proper payment processor will enroll you in \u201cchargeback protection.\u201d Chargeback protection can alert you to any chargebacks in process and allow you to respond to them.

The payment processors often have an \u201cInstant Approval Process,\u201d which overlooks risk. A high-risk merchant can open an account with one of the big three payment processors, start accepting payments, and a month later find out that their account has been terminated. The merchant is often left in the dark, with no understanding of why their account was shut down.</p>",
            "<p>When most payment processors discover that a company is accepting payments in a high-risk space, they are going to shut you down, hold your funds and leave you without a payment solution.</p>",
            "<p>The key to high-risk payment processing is finding a bank that understands your needs. High-risk banks will underwrite every account before they approve it. A high-risk payment processor investigates the merchant\u2019s website to ensure it complies with every rule and restriction in its industry. A thorough investigation allows high-risk payment processors to keep high-risk merchant accounts active.</p>",

If minors purchase your products or there\u2019s another violation of regulations, you can end up in hot water, and so can the payment processor that allowed the transaction to occur.

Customers might purchase an e-cigarette, decide they don\u2019t like its taste or don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective and dispute the charge with their credit card. When a customer disputes a charge, the issuing bank takes the money back. The merchant may or may not be able to cover it, in which case, the payment processor is responsible.</li><li><strong>Potential for legal action:</strong>Vaping is legal but regulated. A merchant that sells its products to people under age 21 or that doesn\u2019t verify age can get in legal trouble. There\u2019s a chance that trouble could extend to the payment processor, which allowed the transaction to go through.</li><li><strong>Potential for reputational harm:</strong>The public\u2019s opinion matters for payment processors. Many processors don\u2019t want to be associated with high-risk industries, including vape shops. Even if an e-cigarette company does everything by the book, some traditional payment processors might hesitate to partner with it.</li></ul>",

            "<h2>The History of Credit Cards</h2>",
            "<p>As a payment method, the credit card isn\u2019t very old, although the concept of credit is. People have been lending money or some form of currency to each other for almost as long as humans have been around. Some historians trace the use of credit<a href=\"https://www.archaeology.org/issues/291-1803/trenches/6363-trenches-kanesh-mesopotamian-trade-networks\" target=\"_blank\">back to the Mesopotamians</a>. The ancient civilization left behind clay tablets that might provide a clue about how it managed trade with others.</p>",
            "<p>Several thousand years later, in the American West, settlers developed a system of credit based on tokens or coins. Merchants would let farmers charge purchases using the tokens. When the harvest came in and the farmers sold their crops, they could repay the merchants.</p>",
            "<p>Outside of the American West, other stores would often let customers run a tab. The customers would purchase and use products from the store, and the owner would record the cost. The customer was then expected to pay off their tab, although there wasn\u2019t an established due date.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/02-The-first-credit-cards-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>The First Credit Cards</h2>",
            "<p>Eventually, the system of using coins or recording customers\u2019 purchases evolved into metal cards, the earliest form of credit cards.<a href=\"https://www.westernunion.com/blog/6-fascinating-things-about-western-unions-history/\" target=\"_blank\">Western Union introduced a product called \u201cmetal money\u201d in 1914</a>. The metal cards let certain people charge purchases at certain stores. They were considerably more limited than today\u2019s plastic cards. However, like some types of credit cards today, only certain people could access them.</p>",
            "<p>One of the issues with metal money and other early forms of credit cards was limited use at a single retailer. That started to change in the 1940s,<a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/the-history-of-credit-cards/\" target=\"_blank\">with the introduction of the Air Travel Card</a>. The Air Travel Card let customers purchase plane tickets from several different airlines. Another early example of the modern credit card<a href=\"https://time.com/4512375/first-credit-card/\" target=\"_blank\">was the \u201cCharg-It\u201d card</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The \u201cCharg-It\u201d card had a very limited customer base. Only people who had an account with Flatbush National Bank in Brooklyn could use the card. Those customers could only utilize their Charg-It card at businesses within a two-block radius of the bank. Merchants that accepted the card would visit the bank to drop off their sales slips and collect payment.</p>",
            "<p>The Diner\u2019s Club Card is another example of a very early credit card. At first, the card was available only to certain men and could only be used for payment at a few restaurants. Eventually, the card grew from its beginnings in the late \u201940s, and the number of people who had access to it increased. At the start, just 200 customers had a Diner\u2019s Club card. Within two years, the number of Diner\u2019s Club members<a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/the-evolution-of-credit-cards/\" target=\"_blank\">had risen to more than 42,000</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Restaurants that accepted the Diner\u2019s Club card agreed to a few terms. They paid a<a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/history-credit-card\" target=\"_blank\">fee of about 7%</a>and had an agreement with the card company. The earliest form of the Diner\u2019s Club Card was more of a charge card than a credit card. Cardholders were expected to pay the entire balance on the card at the end of the billing cycle. There wasn\u2019t the option to let the balance roll over or pay a minimum amount.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/03-The-evolution-of-credit-cards-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>The Evolution of Credit Cards</h2>",
            "<p>The Diner\u2019s Club Card popularity encouraged other companies to get in on the act. The card that saw the first wide acceptance across the United States and allowed customers to carry a balance was the BankAmericard. A few years after its founding, BankAmericard partnered with other credit card companies to create Visa, the first payment processor.</p>",
            "<p>Over time, how credit cards work and their format evolved, too. The magnetic stripe was created in the late 1960s and became widespread in the 1980s. At the time, the magnetic stripe was revolutionary, as it contained information about the card, including the account owner\u2019s name and the card\u2019s number. The strip was more secure than earlier methods of sharing credit card information but not as secure as it could be.</p>",
            "<p>Today, most credit cards contain a tiny computer chip, known as an EMV chip. The chips are encrypted, making it difficult for a bad actor to intercept credit card data. The chips also create a code that\u2019s only valid for a single transaction. If someone manages to steal the EMV chip\u2019s information, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do much with it. The EMV chip was first widely adopted in Europe. It only came into widespread use in the U.S. in the 21st century.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also common for today\u2019s cards to allow for contactless payment, meaning a customer paying in person simply needs to tap or wave their card near a card reader.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/04-The-credit-card-system-today-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>The Credit Card System Today</h2>",
            "<p>Today, millions of people worldwide use credit cards, and numerous companies issue credit cards. Credit card use has been steadily increasing over time. In 2019, people used credit cards to pay for<a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/cash/publications/fed-notes/2019/june/2019-findings-from-the-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice/\" target=\"_blank\">23% of all transactions</a>, rising 2% from 2017.</p>",
            "<p>There are several reasons why credit cards have become one of the most popular methods of payment:</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/05-Payment-processor-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Payment Processing Terms to Know</h2>",
            "<p>Whenever a company accepts a card payment, a cast of characters is involved in the process. Here\u2019s a quick look at who\u2019s who when it comes to paying with and accepting a credit card:</p>",
            "<h2>Payment Processor vs. Gateway</h2>",
            "<p>It can be easy to confuse a payment processor with a payment gateway, but the two are distinct entities in the process of accepting credit and other types of payment cards. The payment processor is the entity that facilitates the credit card transaction. The processor sends transaction data from the merchant to the right bank. In some cases, the processor might provide equipment to the merchant to help it collect credit card information more easily.</p>",
            "<p>A payment gateway is a tool that a merchant uses to send the credit card data to the processer during a transaction. Payment gateways are often used during online transactions or when a customer\u2019s card isn\u2019t physically presented, such as if a person places a phone order.</p>",
            "<p>In some cases, the payment processor can offer a payment gateway. In others, a merchant might need to work with a separate payment gateway provider.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/06-Credit-card-transaction-lifecycle-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Credit Card Transaction Lifecycle</h2>",
            "<p>When a customer gives a merchant their credit card at the end of a purchase or types in their credit card data when shopping online, everything seems to move at the speed of light. The purchase is usually approved or declined within a few seconds.</p>",
            "<p>The speed at which credit card transactions take place conceals the fact that many steps occur along the way. From the minute a customer provides their credit card details, here\u2019s what happens:</p>",
            "<h2>1. Authorization</h2>",
            "<p>Once the customer provides their credit card information, the acquiring bank reaches out to the card network to request authorization. The card information is sent to the network through a payment gateway. The transaction data also gets sent to the customer\u2019s issuing bank to authorize the purchase.</p>",
            "<p>The issuing bank will review the transaction details, including the amount and the card information, and decide whether to approve or decline it. The card issuer might decline a purchase because something about the card data is wrong, such as an incorrect PIN, expiration date or card verification value (CVV) number. If the cardholder doesn\u2019t have enough left in their credit limit to make the purchase, the card issuer might also decline the transaction.</p>",
            "<p>Otherwise, the issuing bank will approve or authorize the transaction if everything checks out.</p>",
            "<h2>2. Batching and Clearing</h2>",
            "<p>Once a purchase is authorized, the issuing bank puts the amount of the transaction on reserve. It doesn\u2019t send the merchant the money immediately. As the day goes on and multiple transactions occur, the number of authorizations increases. By the end of the day, the merchant might have had 100 transactions, each with its own authorization code.</p>",
            "<p>At the close of business for the day or on another schedule, such as every eight hours if the company is open around the clock, the payment processor will send the credit card authorization codes to the merchant\u2019s acquiring bank. The acquiring bank will then batch the authorization codes, sending them to each issuing bank. The issuing bank then pays the acquiring bank.</p>",
            "<h2>3. Funding or Settlement</h2>",
            "<p>After the acquiring bank receives the payment from the card issuers, it still has to pay the merchant. It does that by depositing the money into the merchant\u2019s account. When funding occurs depends on the agreement the merchant has with its bank.</p>",
            "<p>A merchant account operates similarly to a line of credit. Once the funds are cleared in the account, the merchant can access them. But there is a chance that the acquiring bank will need to withdraw the funds again. For example, if a customer has an issue with the purchase and<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/what-are-credit-card-chargebacks/\" target=\"_blank\">requests a chargeback</a>, the card issuer will refund their money. The issuing bank will then expect the merchant to pay for the refund.</p>",
            "<h2>What Are Credit Card Fees for Businesses?</h2>",
            "<p>Credit card fees are part of the cost of doing business in the modern world. If you want to accept online orders, you need to accept card payments. How much your company pays in fees depends on several factors. Different card networks charge various rates, and within a single card network, there might be different rates based on the type of card a customer presents.</p>",
            "<p>Payment processors might also charge customers more or less depending on the industry. Companies that fall into a \u201chigh-risk\u201d category often have to pay more for card processing than lower-risk companies.</p>",
            "<p>Take a look at some of the fees your company might have to pay to accept credit cards.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07-Interchange-fees-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Interchange Fees</h2>",
            "<p>Credit card issuers charge merchants an interchange fee every time a customer uses a credit card. The fee usually consists of a flat rate plus a percentage of the sale, often between 1%-3%.</p>",
            "<p>The card networks typically determine the interchange fee, using multiple conditions to determine how much to charge. The degree of risk involved in the transaction often affects the fee rate. For example, if a customer makes a purchase without physically presenting their card, there is a higher risk of fraud or theft. Some networks charge more for \u201ccard not present\u201d transactions to minimize the effects of theft or fraud.</p>",
            "<p>Whether there are rewards connected to the card also affects the fee charged. Reward cards usually have higher prices, as the extra fees help fund the cards\u2019 rewards programs. Interchange fees also help cover some of the other perks credit card companies offer their customers, such as rental car insurance or purchase protection.</p>",
            "<p>Some merchants refuse to accept certain types of cards or require minimum purchase amounts to minimize the impact of high interchange fees. American Express has had some of the<a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/why-american-express-isnt-universally-accepted/\" target=\"_blank\">highest costs for merchants</a>, so some businesses don\u2019t accept its cards. Similarly, a merchant might require a customer to purchase at least $5 or $10 worth of products to make accepting the card payment worthwhile.</p>",
            "<h2>Assessment Fee</h2>",
            "<p>The credit card network also charges an assessment fee. The assessment fee is based on a merchant\u2019s total sales volume for the month. While the assessment fee is often combined with interchange fees, it\u2019s important to remember that the two aren\u2019t the same.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/08-Payment-processor-fee-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>Payment Processor Fee</h2>",
            "<p>The company that facilitates credit card payments for merchants often charges a fee, too. The fee might be based on a percentage of the merchant\u2019s sales, or it might be a flat rate. Some processors use a combination of methods, charging a flat rate plus a percentage of sales.</p>",
            "<p>A merchant might have to pay an assortment of other fees based on the payment processor it works with and the type of equipment it uses. Some additional fees include:</p>",
            "<h2>Merchant Services Pricing Models Explained</h2>",
            "<p>Your payment processor will most likely offer you the choice of one of several pricing models. A payment processor\u2019s pricing model also influences how much you pay for your merchant services. The three models most often used are:</p>",
            "<h2>1. Tiered Pricing</h2>",
            "<p>With a tiered pricing model, a payment processor charges you a flat rate, plus a percentage of your company\u2019s monthly sales. The rate you pay is based on the type of card a customer uses:</p>",
            "<p>Tiered pricing can be complicated, but it has benefits, such as the option of being customizable. It can be less expensive than other pricing models.</p>",
            "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://zenpayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/09-Flat-rate-pricing-1-1024x512.jpg\"/>",
            "<h2>2. Flat-Rate Pricing</h2>",
            "<p>Many payment processors, such as PayPal and Square, use a flat-rate pricing model. You pay the same percentage for every transaction with flat-rate pricing, such as 2.5%. The rate includes the interchange fee. You also pay a set rate per transaction, such as 10 or 15 cents, in addition to the percentage.</p>",
            "<p>Flat-rate pricing can take some of the guesswork out of paying for credit card processing, as you know what you\u2019ll pay no matter what type of card a customer uses. It can be more expensive than a tiered pricing model, though.</p>",
            "<h2>3. Interchange-Plus or Cost-Plus Pricing</h2>",
            "<p>Interchange-plus or cost-plus pricing tends to be the least expensive of the three pricing models, but it has the greatest variability. With interchange-plus pricing, how much you pay is based on the following:</p>",

            "<h2>How to Save Money on Credit Card Processing</h2>",
            "<p>Some merchants prefer to save money on credit card processing by not accepting card payments. As the world moves online and the demand for cashless and contactless payments increases, refusing card payments is becoming a less viable option for businesses. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to cut the cost of card processing:</p>",
            "<h2>How to Protect Credit Card Data as a Business</h2>",
            "<p>A certain amount of trust is required when customers use a credit card during a transaction. They trust that your company will use the card honestly and won\u2019t charge more than the transaction amount. They also trust that their card and personal information will be kept secure. As a company, it\u2019s up to you to make sure your customer\u2019s credit card data is safe and that it doesn\u2019t fall into the wrong hands.</p>",
            "<p>One way to ensure the protection and security of credit card data is to follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and become PCI compliant.</p>",
            "<h2>What Is PCI Compliance?</h2>",
            "<p>To become PCI compliant, a business needs to<a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security\" target=\"_blank\">follow 12 requirements</a>:</p>",
            "<h2>How to Choose the Best Credit Card Processor for Your Business</h2>",
            "<p>Not all credit card processors are the same. They vary in terms of the fees they charge, the type of support they offer and the industries they serve. While some processors try to present themselves as \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d and ideal for any merchant, the reality is that some companies are better served by working with a processor that specializes in specific industries.</p>",
            "<p>When<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/choosing-a-credit-card-processor/\" target=\"_blank\">choosing a payment processor</a>, pay attention to the following qualities.</p>",

            "<h2>Rates</h2>",
            "<p>Get an idea of the rates the credit card processor will charge before you agree to work with it. Ask what type of pricing model it uses and see a breakdown of the fees you can expect to pay monthly. The processor should be upfront with you about its costs and how it determines who pays what.</p>",
            "<p>It can also be worthwhile to find out if the payment processor changes its rates occasionally or if you will pay the same amount for the entire time you have the account.</p>",
            "<h2>Setup</h2>",
            "<p>Ideally, getting up and running with the payment processor will be simple. Any delays in the process can affect your company\u2019s ability to accept payments and complete transactions, so you want the transition to be seamless.</p>",
            "<p>Ask the company what is involved in setting up the new system and whether you\u2019ll keep using specific equipment or software. Once you know how long the processor thinks it will take to get the system up and running, pay attention to how long the process takes. If the payment processor gets you set up within the time predicted or even earlier, that\u2019s a good sign that it will follow through on other promises it makes you.</p>",

            "<h2>Industry Experience</h2>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also ideal if the payment processor you partner with has experience working with companies in your industry, particularly if you\u2019re in a high-risk industry. Several features can cause a company to fall into the high-risk category, such as:</p>",
            "<p>A payment processor specializing in high-risk industries will be familiar with the particular challenges the industries face and will be more likely to have policies to accommodate the companies it works with.</p>",

Look for a payment processor that has a good customer service reputation.</p>",
            "<p>Choose a company with representatives available around the clock, especially if you operate online. If customers order from you 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you want to be able to connect with your payment processor 24/7, too.</p>",

            "<p>Find out what type of equipment the processor offers if you\u2019ll be accepting cards in person. You\u2019ll want an EMV reader at the minimum, as it\u2019s more secure than older magnetic stripe readers.</p>",

            "<p>Contacting a high risk payment processor is your best way to resolve a credit hold. Firstly, they are well versed in dealing with industries that have processing difficulties. High risk processors provide a specific type of account, one that has separate allowances for issues like chargebacks,<strong><a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/safeselling/payment/\">legal regulations</a></strong>, and international sales.</p>",
            "<p>High risk merchant providers won\u2019t give you direct advice on your existing situation, but an informative customer support agent can help you better understand what may have caused your credit issue and account freeze .</p>",
            "<p>Most importantly, they will do everything they can to get you a new operational merchant account . If your account is frozen, that means your website or business won\u2019t be able to accept credit card payments. This can be crippling for any business who has a steady transaction flow.

            "<ul><li><b>Potential Fraud</b>\u2013 Fraud can come in many forms, and when a bank puts your credit card processing on hold, they might not divulge the reason why. It could be that there are multiple high ticket transactions coming from peculiar sources, or they may find that your products are not the same ones they thought you were selling. In any case, you may be able to find signs of fraud before your payment processor does, so be sure to look for potential issues beforehand.</li></ul>",
            "<ul><li><b>Selling New Products</b>\u2013 Similarly, if you sell new products on your website that were not initially approved by your payment processor they can freeze your account.

            "<h2>Suspicious Email Addresses</h2>",
            "<p>This is one of the most common types of credit card scams you might face. If an email address used to make a purchase looks suspicious, it\u2019s best to double-check before processing credit card payments. This could be anything from an obviously fake name to a misspelling in the email address. It\u2019s important to remember that some scammers are good at hiding their true identities. The more vigilant you are, the better you will recognize email addresses like these.</p>",
            "<h2>Suspicious Transactions</h2>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also important to be aware of suspicious transactions. These could range from customers making a large number of purchases in a short period of time or orders shipped to multiple different addresses. You can save yourself a lot of trouble by being proactive.</p>",
            "<h2>Large Orders With No Shopping History</h2>",
            "<p>In general, people will purchase more goods the better they know your brand. For example, it\u2019s unlikely that somebody would spend thousands of dollars the first time shopping with a business.</p>",
            "<p>If you have no history of this customer and they make a large order, this could be a red flag you need to investigate.</p>",
            "<h2>Different Cards From the Same IP Address</h2>",
            "<p>A situation like this can indicate a scammer trying to buy goods with stolen credit cards.</p>",
            "<p>If you notice multiple purchases from the same IP address but different cards, it\u2019s best to take extra steps before processing any payments. This becomes true with a higher number of cards.</p>",
            "<p>For example, the use of two cards from the same IP address often isn\u2019t a cause for alarm. The use of eight cards from the same IP address, though, certainly is.</p>",
            "<h2>Mass Account Modifications</h2>",
            "<p>This could include password changes, shipping address modifications, or any other alterations.</p>",
            "<p>This could be a sign that a scammer has stolen someone\u2019s account and is trying to use it for fraudulent orders. Unfortunately, this can be a difficult situation to overcome \u2014 scammers sometimes use dozens of compromised accounts at once.</p>",
            "<h2>A High Number of Chargeback Requests</h2>",
            "<p>When someone initiates a chargeback, it means they are disputing a transaction or are claiming that someone has stolen their credit card information. If you notice an unusually high number of chargeback requests, look into this matter. Chargebacks can be difficult for many businesses to deal with. This is especially true if they occur on a regular basis.</p>",
            "<h2>The Use of Virtual Machines</h2>",
            "<p>This means someone is using a computer to appear as if they are in a different location. This could be a sign of someone trying to hide their true location while making fraudulent purchases. Scammers sometimes use virtual machines to facilitate international shipping. They might be located in an Asian or European country but pose as if they are in the United States.</p>",

            "<p>Although the number of risks may seem overwhelming, there are steps you can take in order to protect yourself. This will go a long way when it comes to circumventing fraudulent activity in the future. Let\u2019s explore some of the most notable.</p>",
            "<h3>Require Extra Authentication</h3>",
            "<p>Depending on the type of purchase someone is trying to make, you may want to ask for additional authentication. This could be anything from a separate photo identification to the last four digits of their social security number. It\u2019s important to keep in mind, though, that you should only require extra authentication for high-value items. Otherwise, you run the risk of inconveniencing your customers.</p>",
            "<h3>Take the Time to Dispute Chargebacks</h3>",
            "<p>Interestingly, many business owners are unaware that you can<strong><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/chargeback\">dispute a chargeback</a></strong>if you feel the customer is being dishonest or fraudulent. It\u2019s important to take the time to look into these cases and do your due diligence before disputing them.</p>",

By utilizing a<strong><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\">high-risk payment processing solution</a></strong>, you\u2019ll have access to tools and resources that will make it easier to detect suspicious activity.</p>",
            "<p>This is especially important for businesses that accept payments online or over the phone as these are more likely to become targets of criminals. When looking for a solution provider, be sure to consider both their reputation and the security measures they offer.</p>",
            "<p>Researching past online reviews will also help you make a more informed decision. Take a look at what other people have had to say about their experience. This will provide valuable insight into what you can expect from a credit card processing payment solution.</p>",

            "<h2>Choose the Right Merchant Account</h2>",
            "<p>Accepting secure payments starts with choosing the right merchant account. If you don\u2019t have the right merchant account on your side, a variety of things could go wrong. It is important to make sure the merchant account provider you choose is reputable.</p>",
            "<p>Some providers seem real and reputable when they\u2019re not. Some merchant account providers are scammers. They may get your information and use it against you.</p>",
            "<p>Your best bet is to go to<strong><a href=\"https://www.business.com/articles/online-payment-security-tips/\">a bank</a></strong>to get a merchant account. But this is not always possib le. Some banks will not give you a merchant account if your line of business does not follow the bank\u2019s guidelines.</p>",
            "<p>Suppose you have a high-risk business. This kind of business may deal in cannabis products, firearms, and other products that may exist in a legal gray area. Most banks will not provide merchant accounts to these businesses because they are too risky.</p>",
            "<h3>The Details</h3>",
            "<p>The banks won\u2019t want to take the risk of giving you a merchant account as this may reflect badly on the bank. Does this mean that you have to go without a merchant account if you have a high-risk business? Not at all.</p>",
            "<p>You can instead seek out a<strong><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\">merchant account</a></strong>provider that specializes in high-risk accounts. These providers won\u2019t have any problem supplying you with a merchant account no matter what risky items you\u2019re selling. It is still important to double-check your account provider options.</p>",
            "<p>If the provider has many good reviews and a good reputation, you shouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about. But if the provider seems shady or has many bad reviews, you should be wary. Such a provider may not seem as professional as it seems.</p>",
            "<p>You shouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about as long as you do your research beforehand and double-check your choices.</p>",
            "<h2>Use Strong Customer Authentication</h2>",
            "<p>Once you have a merchant account, you\u2019ll have a good foundation for safely accepting payments. But many things could still go wrong with payment processing from this point on. Accepting business payments still needs a few extra layers of protection.</p>",
            "<p>An important layer is strong customer authentication or SCA. This is one of the best credit card processing tools that help deter scammers and fraudulent payments. This tool is best for online credit card payments.</p>",
            "<p>It requires a customer to go through a few extra steps of authorization before they can go through with their payment. This is important because most payment systems don\u2019t have these extra steps. They may require the customer to input their payment information and that\u2019s it.</p>",
            "<p>But this makes it very easy for scammers to commit fraud. The extra steps involved in SCA are related to the customer\u2019s personal information. This personal information may be a PIN or a long password.</p>",
            "<h3>What You Need to Know</h3>",
            "<p>Some SCAs are especially secure and may also require the customer to present a device such as a smartphone or personal ID. But if you want to be extra secure, you can go a step further. Some SCAs also require voice recognition or fingerprints from the customer.</p>",
            "<p>This is not always necessary, especially if you\u2019re dealing with small payments. But if you are selling more expensive or rare items, these extra security steps may be important. They make it very difficult for fraud to be committed.</p>",
            "<p>Using SCA can also make you feel much more relaxed about accepting payments. Instead of worrying that something might go wrong or that you might get scammed, you can focus on your work. The SCA will do all the heavy lifting for you.</p>",
            "<p>Using this along with other security measures can be a big help.</p>",
            "<h2>Always Be on the Lookout for Fraud</h2>",
            "<p>You should never let your guard down when accepting credit card payments. Whether you\u2019re accepting payments online, with mobile, or in person, you always need to be alert. This is because fraud and scams can strike at any time.</p>",
            "<p>The moment you let your guard down is when something bad might happen. But if you\u2019re always prepared, you\u2019ll never have to worry about that problem. This is why it is important to have a good foundation with your merchant account provider.</p>",
            "<p>Having a safe and reputable provider will put you on the right track. Having tools like SCAs can add a few extra layers of protection over your payment processing endeavors. There are also built-in fraud monitoring tools that you can use that go the extra mile.</p>",

            "<p>You would also need the right software to accept credit card payments in this fashion. If you don\u2019t want to go through all this, you can go through a payment processing service instead. There are many processing service options like PayPal or Square.</p>",
            "<p>These services work very similarly to merchant accounts. You can also manage their settings online. This ensures that the payments go through exactly how you want them to.</p>",
            "<p>This makes it easy to deposit money into your bank account, issue refunds, and so on. If you are a new business and still very small, it may be best to choose a payment processing service. This is because these services are very simple to use and don\u2019t require much information to get set up. They are also quite safe.</p>",
            "<h3>The Details</h3>",
            "<p>If you are a larger and more established business, it may be better to get a merchant account. These accounts are more detailed and have sturdier foundations.</p>",
            "<p>You should also be aware of credit card processing fees when you choose a provider. Every provider is different. Some may charge a monthly or annual service fee for credit card transactions.</p>",
            "<p>Others may instead charge a transaction fee or interchange rate every time you process a credit card. This fee may be fixed or it may be a percentage of whatever payment goes through. Understanding these different options is important for making the right option for you and your business.</p>",
            "<p>It is also important for safely accepting credit card payments. Some credit card processors have extra security measures designed to keep you and your information safe. Knowing these options ahead of time can keep you safe from fraudulent payments and other scams.</p>",

            "<p>It is important to review the customer\u2019s payment information before proceeding. There are certain things you can look for that might give you a sign as to whether there is fraud afoot. The best credit cards to accept are those from well-known and respected banks.</p>",
            "<p>Premium credit cards are also good choices. This is because people who use these cards are very responsible with their money. It would be very unlikely for people with these credit cards to try and do anything shady.</p>",
            "<h3>What You Need to Know</h3>",
            "<p>You should be wary of credit cards from very small and unfamiliar banks or banks that have a bad reputation. These credit cards may not be as legit as they seem. You should also check the basic payment information such as the billing and shipping addresses.</p>",
            "<p>If these two addresses are very far apart, this may be a sign that you\u2019re dealing with fraud. This is not always true, but it is important to be cautious if you feel unsure about payment.</p>",
            "<h2>Other Factors to Consider</h2>",
            "<p>Accepting mobile payments is very similar to accepting online payments. You need to use a mobile app to do this. The great thing about accepting mobile payments is that you can accept them wherever you might be.</p>",

            "<p>Others might be scams designed to inconvenience you. This is why it is important to do your research before choosing a credit card processor. Look at what other people are saying about a processor online.</p>",
            "<p>Does that processor have a good reputation? Or do most reviewers have bad things to say? This can help you narrow down your options so you don\u2019t accidentally make the wrong decision.</p>",
            "<p>Having a good credit card processor on your side will make your eCommerce journey much easier. You will be less likely to encounter credit card processing problems as well. This will save you time and energy.</p>",

If you have a<strong><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/processing-services-high-risk/\">high-risk merchant account</a></strong>, some payment processors won\u2019t accept you. They may find your business to be too risky to accept.</p>",
            "<p>This can make it difficult to find the right processing service for your needs. You might choose a service that does the bare minimum to get your business accepted. But you can avoid all these issues by taking your time and researching your options.</p>",

When possible, avoid manually entering card data to optimize interchange rates.</li><li><b>Include all required transaction data</b>: Ensure that all required transaction data, such as the card\u2019s expiration date, CVV code, and address verification, is included when processing transactions. The result is reduced fraud risk and lower interchange rates.</li><li>Settle transactions promptly : Settling transactions promptly, usually within 24 to 48 hours, can help keep costs down.

            "<p>Furthermore, in-person transactions (also known as<b>card-present</b>) aren\u2019t practical for many agencies because payments are usually over the phone or online. As such, there is added risk when a merchant cannot see and verify who is making the transaction.</p>",

            "<p><b>Increased Payment Options:</b>Accepting credit card payments expands your payment options beyond cash and checks, allowing debtors to pay using the method that suits them best. This can result in higher payment rates and improved cash flow.</p>",
            "<p><b>Payment Gateway:</b>A payment gateway for your business is the management tool that allows you to track payments, generate reports, and reconcile transactions. This can help you see who is paying when and generate forecasting to expand on new business models.</p>",

Nonetheless, Stripe wouldn\u2019t be your payment processor of choice, but a high risk provider would be able to get you the credit card processing capabilities you need.</li><li>Breaches of Trademarks and Copyrights \u2013 Any items that attempt to steal a business identity or sell items without explicit permission from a company whose goods they\u2019re selling would not be allowed. There are many examples of this that are actually quite common. For example, if you sell Apple watches and aren\u2019t a licensed retailer, then you\u2019d be going against<b>Stripes regulations</b>.

If you\u2019re operating a company that is structured without legitimate product offerings and instead sells the ruse of independence at a cost, then you\u2019ll have to have an alternative payment processor.</li><li>Adult \u2013 Although there continues to be a high demand for Adult streaming, products, and enhancement medicine, these industries are considered high risk. The good news is that although you<b>can\u2019t process with Stripe</b>, there are many choices to serve your business with alternative banking channels.</li><li>Gambling and Online Gaming \u2013 Another state-by-state industry,<b>online gaming</b>continues to gain traction around the country with a widening legal landscape. In addition, the allure of a big one and well-placed sports bets draws more gamblers each year. Skip Stripe and contact Zen Payments if you\u2019re interested in processing in the online gambling industry.</li><li>Location Exclusions \u2013 There is a long list of different countries that have their own rules when it comes to merchant accounts. If you\u2019re selling<b>international items</b>you\u2019ll want to see what\u2019s allowed according to your specific location.</li><li>Pharmaceuticals \u2013 These are companies that sell medication online.

When they figure out the type of businesses you\u2019re running they will shut down your account.</li><li><b>High Chargebacks</b>\u2013 Companies are only allowed a certain number or<b>percentage of chargebacks</b>. These are also a good indicator of fraud or businesses that haven\u2019t ironed out a proper sales or distribution channel. If you exceed the allotted amount you agreed upon with your payment processor, then you\u2019ll be dropped</li><li><b>Volume Limit Reached</b>\u2013 This is the best case scenario when it comes to a suspended merchant account.

            "<p><b>Flat Rate Payment</b>\u2013 The seller sets a negotiable rate for the item they\u2019re selling.

The Seller can accept that offer and notify the buyer to complete the transaction.</p>",
            "<p><b>Auction Style Listing</b>\u2013 Auction-based listings usually start low and work their way up over time. As more people view, and take interest in an item, the true value is more closely reflected. The item is also listed for a predetermined time. At the end of time, the highest bidder wins the ability to purchase the product. This format helps the seller receive the highest payment in the market. To note, the final day of biddings is when the value of most listings increases drastically.</p>",

Most banks don\u2019t want to see your rates exceed 1% because it causes added work on their end. In addition, high chargeback rates affect your bottom line. When a chargeback occurs, the money is taken directly from your merchant account.</p>",
            "<p>Refunds can also hurt your company and high refund rates are seen as a precursor to chargebacks. If you notice many people returning your products, be sure to create a process where you can monitor what\u2019s causing those issues and prevent them from occurring.</p>",
            "<p><b>Credit Scores</b>\u2013 If you have a<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/industries-bad-credit/\">low credit score</a>and want to start a business, you may face higher reserve rates on your account. This is because your merchant account provider wants to hedge risk when it comes to opening an account for your business operation. On the plus side, many providers will give you the processing solution you need if your credit score is within a reasonable range.</p>",
            "<p><b>Regulated Industries</b>\u2013 As mentioned above there is a long list of regulated industries such as<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/how-can-payment-processing-impact-cbd-merchants/\">CBD</a>,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/adult-products-merchant-account/\">Adult</a>,<a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/firearms-businesses-and-susceptibility-to-chargebacks/\">Firearms</a>and more.

            "<p>Volume is a major factor in determining risk. If you process tens of thousands of dollars a month, or if you have a very high per-transaction rate, you may qualify as high-risk.</p>",
            "<p>Accepting international payments comes with a greater risk of fraud, which could cause a processor to denote you as high-risk. If you are a brand new business that has no history of processing credit card transaction or have a low credit score, that too could elevate your status to high risk as well.</p>",
            "<p>One of the most common ways that merchants get a high-risk designation is the nature of their business. For instance, if you run a subscription-based company, it is more likely that customers will try it than cancel. Industries like travel, gambling, e-commerce, CBD and vape products, and debt collection agencies often get a high-risk demarcation due to the nature of their business.</p>",

            "<p>Being a high-risk merchant means that processors and banks must do something to protect themselves from risk. That is because they are responsible for lost revenue from transactions involving fraud or abuse. This usually translates to special registration fees and higher or differently-structured processing fees.</p>",
            "<p>Some payment processors will not agree to do business with merchants that fall into this category. But many payment processors specialize in this type of business.</p>",
            "<h3>Set-Up Visa/Mastercard High Risk Registration Fees</h3>",
            "<p>Sep-Up fees are distinct from registration feeds. As the name suggests, these cover the costs of setting up your merchant account. They can be upwards of several thousand dollars, depending on the agency you use.</p>",
            "<p>Also, note that some processors might waive or reduce these charges to be more competitive. The important thing is that you ensure that these are spelled out in the contract</p>",
            "<h3>Registration</h3>",
            "<p>So that you can begin accepting credit card payments, the processor will need to register your business as a high-risk merchant. Both Visa and Mastercard charge a $500 fee every year for the registration.</p>",
            "<p>Once registration is complete, it is a good idea to take a look at your Merchant Category Code (MCC). This is a four-digit number that applies to the type of goods or services you provide. The credit card company will create this code once you are registered with them, and they start accepting payments from you.</p>",
            "<p>These are important for tax purposes but also because they are used to denote riskier lines of business credit. There are myriad<a href=\"https://awardwallet.com/merchants\">online tools</a>for accessing your MCC.</p>",
            "<p>The most important thing to look out for is if you are not categorized as a high-risk merchant. That means you will<em>not</em>have to pay a special high-risk registration fee each year. This is the case even if your payment processor disagrees with the categorization.</p>",
            "<h3>High-Risk Credit Card Processing Fees</h3>",
            "<p>There are many different models for setting up what credit card processing fee high-risk merchants will pay. The rate should be the same for Visa processing and Mastercard processing but could differ for other types of cards.</p>",
            "<p>The most common is a flat rate, where there is either a fixed percentage or a fixed fee per transaction. These are ideal for businesses with a low processing volume. Note that these rates could come down over time once you have established a good relationship with the provider.</p>",
            "<p>A tiered model allows the processor to group transactions based on the level of risk. Examples are \u201cqualified,\u201d \u2018mid-qualified,\u201d and \u201cnon-qualified\u201d rates.</p>",
            "<p>Qualified rates meet all the requirements of the provider. Examples include in-person transactions in your store. Mid-qualified rates apply to transactions that may entail a higher risk of fraud, such as online transactions.</p>",
            "<p>Non-qualified rates apply to transactions like e-commerce or reward cards that meet none of the processor\u2019s requirements. They will carry the highest fees.</p>",
            "<p>The big downside to this model is that the processor gets to determine which transactions fall into said categories.</p>",
            "<p>There are other models, such as \u201csubscription,\u201d where you pay a set fee every month and then a fixed percentage per transaction. These can save you money if you have a higher processing volume.</p>",

            "<ul><li><b>Low Fees</b>\u2013 This one speaks for itself, low fees on your account mean saving money and not having to cut a big check at the end of each month for the service.</li><li><b>Adaptable Billing</b>\u2013 On top of low fees, it\u2019s important to know how they work and what you can customize on your account to make it a better fit. For example, if your website accepts tips, then you may have a higher number of transactions, or even<b>microtransactions</b>which can be pennies at a time. In this case, you\u2019d benefit from lower transaction costs rather than lower overall percentage fees.</li><li><b>Customer Support</b>\u2013 Intelligent, helpful, USA-based sales and customer services professionals are essential when shopping for a merchant account. You\u2019ll be sharing personal information and business records so you want to make sure you trust your provider and they guide you through the process.</li><li><b>High Approvals</b>\u2013 It goes without saying, but at the end of the day you need a merchant account that\u2019s open and processes payments. High approval rates are key for adult businesses, because many large providers will turn you down.</li><li><b>Fast Underwriting and Approvals</b>\u2013 Nobody likes providing paperwork and documents just to wait to hear back from a bank. Zen Payments focuses on keeping the merchant first. Fast responses and<strong><a href=\"https://zenpayments.com/instant-merchant-account/\">quick approvals</a></strong>are the name of the game.</li></ul>"
